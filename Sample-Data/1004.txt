Introduction: Recent studies about lunar domes 

are based on the evaluation of their spectrophotometric 

and morphometric properties, rheologic parameters, 

and their classification based on the spectral properties 

and three dimensional shapes of the volcanic edifices 

[1-3]. In this contribution we provide an analysis of 

three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus 

region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and 

Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are 

characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-
ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).

UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian 

(M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image. 

 

     Morphometric dome properties: Based on the 

telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of 

the examined domes by applying the combined 

photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) 

described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 

were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank 

slopes of 1.0°, 0.64° and 0.54°, respectively (Fig. 2 and 

3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice 

volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km
3
 for 

three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the 

height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in 

the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a 

value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-

graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

    GLD100 dataset: Scholten et al. present a nearly 

global lunar DEM with a grid size of 100 m, the so-

called GLD100 [4]. This DEM has been constructed 

based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC 

image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to 

access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the 

cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view 

(Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with 

photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.  

    According to the classification scheme for lunar 

domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal 

component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 

belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to 

class E2.

(width W and length L). For three domes we found

 and dike 

lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 

9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. 

With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is 

a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-

duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to 

group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

    Introduction: To the north-east of the crater 

Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of 

mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 

100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-

ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain 

in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-

ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-

longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears 

to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark 

Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is 

however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from 

this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this 
contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and 

associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43° N 

and 5.10° W (Figs. 1a-1b). 

Morphometric properties: The dome, termed 

Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-

mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m 

and the average slope angle ξ corresponds to 0.65°. Its 

edifice volume was estimated of 97 km
3
. An elongate 

depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the 

dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, 

the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse 

feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a 

source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral 

mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated 

with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other 

foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in 

Fig. 1d). 

Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral 

data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the 

dome and associated deposits which show up bluer 

than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 

ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the 

nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-

0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our 

data indicate that the “relatively” higher TiO2 and FeO 

value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to 

nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic 

material (Figs. 1f-g). The M
3
 spectral data indicate that 

the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface 

east of it slightly exceeds 1 µm. The 2 µm absorption is 

quite flat while the 1 µm absorption is shifted towards 

higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for 

olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to 

glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-

cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-

ture was identified.  

The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in 

the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their 

strong 2 µm absorptions and extremely weak or absent 

1 µm absorptions.  

     Results and discussion: The environs of the dome 

present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-

dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and 

graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, 

pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 

1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-

denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset 

it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-

tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile 

dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to 

the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the 

dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that 

extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley 

Formation terrain and across the western part of the 

dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as 

a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a 

magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended 

to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the 

bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-

mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-

tion between volcanic products and the surface may 

occur through the fractures that form to allow the 

graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive 

processes, including pyroclastic material, might be 

involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but 

not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic 

phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-

amined lunar region may even have formed completely 

independent of each other. The fact that the examined 

dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-

ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-

matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by 

a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-

lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] 

yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma 

pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome 

SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-

duced in [9-10].

ON  THE  VARIATIONS  OF  GALACTIC  COSMIC  RAYS  DURING  THE  LAST  BILLION  YEARS.

Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of 

cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv 

[1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays 

(GCR) varied with a period of 143 ± 10 Myr due to 

periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral 

arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this 

period is equal to 147 ± 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-

clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-

er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the 

ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of 

ages from the available data set. We compared ob-

tained results with results for the model set of ages 

assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-

tions.  

Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 

82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were 

taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to 

paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we 

used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-

tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-

gram 2). 

Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-

ed values of ages was made by means of calculating 

the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of 

parameters of the distribution of these values. For each 

value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was 

calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). 

Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages 

and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity 

of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 

1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-

lated the population characteristics of the distribution 

of phase values: dispersion S
2
, kurtosis Ek and χ

2
. This 

procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 

200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each 

characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. 

Results for the χ2 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we 

can see: (a) changes of χ2 for the corrected ages of iron 

meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random 

"true" values of ages, assuming no variations of the 

GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR 

variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same 

on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 

450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with 

such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 

2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the χ2 values 

for t ~ 400-500 Myr (Δ2 = -44 ± 4 %) and less con-

vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (Δ1 = -46 ± 13 %). 

Also, similar deviations from the mean values were 

obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-

persion S
2 
and kurtosis Ek. 

Distribution of the model set of 100 values of 

"true" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-

bution of the "measured" values of ages will be the 

same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the 

last billion years has not changed. Distribution of 

"measured" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 

4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied 

with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution 

is significantly different from the distribution of ages 

of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of 

the "measured" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the 

same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites 

(Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR 

intensity variations of 450 Myr. 

Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-

istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of 

~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-

iations may be due to periodic passing solar system 

through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 

8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 

Myr are less certain.

EFFECTS OF SECONDARY PROCESSING ON PRESOLAR GRAIN ABUNDANCES AND 
COMPOSITIONS IN THE UNIQUE CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITE MILLER RANGE 07687. C. Floss1 
and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis,

Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered 

or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest 
degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous 
alteration [1–3], and have been found in abundance 
only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a 
result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular 
and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. 

MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but 
contains unique features that distinguish it from typical 
CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of 
refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO 
chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and 
fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in 
COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. 
However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is 
that it appears to have undergone a unique style of 
highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix 
is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped 
Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions 
separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).  

 
Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix 
from MIL 07687. 

In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high 
abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in 
fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous 
silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in 
MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the 
abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the 
matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the 
secondary alteration it has experienced. 

Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 
50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix 
areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees 
of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 
33,900 µm2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich 

altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively 
unaltered Fe-poor matrix. 

Following isotopic identification of the grains, we 
used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major 
element compositions of the grains, following standard 
procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. 

Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar 
grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 
110 ± 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 ± 19 ppm for 
SiC, in good agreement with the abundances 
determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains 
belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains 
have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to 
as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2). 

 
Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich 

presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other 
data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. 

Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all 
of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide 
grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly 
consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with 
Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or 
pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. 
Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 
at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges 
and medians observed for presolar silicates from 
primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 
and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 
[e.g., 1 and references therein]. 

Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of 
MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing 
silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 

1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)



other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites 
(Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are 
extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe 
oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or 
akaganéite [7, 8]. 

 
Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-

poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from 
MIL 07687. 

The results of our imaging survey indicate that 
presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-
poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the 
aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not 
resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. 
However, we do see some differences in the presolar 
grain abundances between the two types of matrix. 
Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-
poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 
1000 µm2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 
grains per 1000 µm2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. 
Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are 
again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered 
ones. However, the difference is not as large as might 
be expected given that presolar silicates are more 
susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar 
grain types. 

In addition to the difference in abundance, we 
observe compositional differences in the presolar 
silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains 
from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content 
than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 

at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the 
ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which 
have a factor of two higher median Fe content than 
presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. 
In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx 
of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing 
experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe 
content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix 
areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this 
case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of 
Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and 
subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.

per 1000 µm2) in MIL 07687. 
Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the 

SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix 
areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 µm2. This difference 
is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more 
resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate 
grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact 
that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are 
the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix 
areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly 
oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to 
the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those 
matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration.

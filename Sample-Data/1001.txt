Introduction: Recent studies about lunar domes 

are based on the evaluation of their spectrophotometric 

and morphometric properties, rheologic parameters, 

and their classification based on the spectral properties 

and three dimensional shapes of the volcanic edifices 

[1-3]. In this contribution we provide an analysis of 

three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus 

region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and 

Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are 

characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-
ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).

     Morphometric dome properties: Based on the 

telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of 

the examined domes by applying the combined 

photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) 

described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 

were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank 

slopes of 1.0°, 0.64° and 0.54°, respectively (Fig. 2 and 

3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice 

volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km
3
 for 

three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the 

height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in 

the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a 

value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-

graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

    GLD100 dataset: Scholten et al. present a nearly 

global lunar DEM with a grid size of 100 m, the so-

called GLD100 [4]. This DEM has been constructed 

based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC 

image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to 

access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the 

cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view 

(Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with 

photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.  

    According to the classification scheme for lunar 

domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal 

component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 

belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to 

class E2.

effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-

cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-

metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic 

properties for the examined domes (Table 2). 

    The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava 

viscosity of 10
4
 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have 

inferred lava viscosities of ~10

a lava density of 2800 kg m

. The domes formed over a 

period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 

years (W3).  

According to the model developed in [6], we esti-

mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry 

(width W and length L). For three domes we found 

magma rise speeds of the order 10

 and dike 

lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 

9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. 

With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is 

a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-

duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to 

group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

Introduction: Recent studies about lunar domes 

are based on the evaluation of their spectrophotometric 

and morphometric properties, rheologic parameters, 

and their classification based on the spectral properties 

and three dimensional shapes of the volcanic edifices 

[1-3]. In this contribution we provide an analysis of 

three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus 

region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and 

Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are 

characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-
ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).

UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian 

(M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image. 

 

     Morphometric dome properties: Based on the 

telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of 

the examined domes by applying the combined 

photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) 

described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 

were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank 

slopes of 1.0°, 0.64° and 0.54°, respectively (Fig. 2 and 

3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice 

volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km
3
 for 

three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the 

height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in 

the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a 

value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-

graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

    GLD100 dataset: Scholten et al. present a nearly 

global lunar DEM with a grid size of 100 m, the so-

called GLD100 [4]. This DEM has been constructed 

based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC 

image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to 

access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the 

cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view 

(Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with 

photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.  

    According to the classification scheme for lunar 

domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal 

component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 

belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to 

class E2.

cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-

metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic 

properties for the examined domes (Table 2).

period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16

According to the model developed in [6], we esti-

mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry 

(width W and length L). For three domes we found 

magma rise speeds of the order 10

 and dike 

lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 

9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. 

With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is 

a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-

duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to 

group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

    Introduction: To the north-east of the crater 

Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of 

mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 

100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-

ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain 

in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-

ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-

longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears 

to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark 

Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is 

however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from 

this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this 
contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and 

associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43° N 

and 5.10° W (Figs. 1a-1b). 

Morphometric properties: The dome, termed 

Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-

mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m 

and the average slope angle ξ corresponds to 0.65°. Its 

edifice volume was estimated of 97 km
3
. An elongate 

depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the 

dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, 

the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse 

feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a 

source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral 

mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated 

with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other 

foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in 

Fig. 1d). 

Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral 

data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the 

dome and associated deposits which show up bluer 

than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 

ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the 

nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-

0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our 

data indicate that the “relatively” higher TiO2 and FeO 

value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to 

nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic 

material (Figs. 1f-g). The M
3
 spectral data indicate that 

the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface 

east of it slightly exceeds 1 µm. The 2 µm absorption is 

quite flat while the 1 µm absorption is shifted towards 

higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for 

olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to 

glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-

cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-

ture was identified.  

The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in 

the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their 

strong 2 µm absorptions and extremely weak or absent 

1 µm absorptions.  

     Results and discussion: The environs of the dome 

present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-

dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and 

graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, 

pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 

1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-

denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset 

it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-

tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile 

dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to 

the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the 

dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that 

extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley 

Formation terrain and across the western part of the 

dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as 

a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a 

magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended 

to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the 

bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-

mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-

tion between volcanic products and the surface may 

occur through the fractures that form to allow the 

graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive 

processes, including pyroclastic material, might be 

involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but 

not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic 

phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-

amined lunar region may even have formed completely 

independent of each other. The fact that the examined 

dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-

ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-

matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by 

a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-

lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] 

yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma 

pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome 

SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-

duced in [9-10].

Introduction: Recent studies about lunar domes 

are based on the evaluation of their spectrophotometric 

and morphometric properties, rheologic parameters, 

and their classification based on the spectral properties 

and three dimensional shapes of the volcanic edifices 

[1-3]. In this contribution we provide an analysis of 

three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus 

region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and 

Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are 

characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-
ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).

UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian 

(M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image. 

 

     Morphometric dome properties: Based on the 

telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of 

the examined domes by applying the combined 

photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) 

described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 

were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank 

slopes of 1.0°, 0.64° and 0.54°, respectively (Fig. 2 and 

3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice 

volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km
3
 for 

three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the 

height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in 

the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a 

value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-

graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

    GLD100 dataset: Scholten et al. present a nearly 

global lunar DEM with a grid size of 100 m, the so-

called GLD100 [4]. This DEM has been constructed 

based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC 

image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to 

access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the 

cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view 

(Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with 

photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.  

    According to the classification scheme for lunar 

domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal 

component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 

belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to 

class E2.

(width W and length L). For three domes we found

 and dike 

lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 

9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. 

With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is 

a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-

duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to 

group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

    Introduction: To the north-east of the crater 

Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of 

mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 

100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-

ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain 

in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-

ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-

longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears 

to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark 

Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is 

however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from 

this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this 
contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and 

associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43° N 

and 5.10° W (Figs. 1a-1b). 

Morphometric properties: The dome, termed 

Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-

mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m 

and the average slope angle ξ corresponds to 0.65°. Its 

edifice volume was estimated of 97 km
3
. An elongate 

depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the 

dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, 

the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse 

feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a 

source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral 

mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated 

with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other 

foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in 

Fig. 1d). 

Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral 

data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the 

dome and associated deposits which show up bluer 

than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 

ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the 

nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-

0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our 

data indicate that the “relatively” higher TiO2 and FeO 

value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to 

nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic 

material (Figs. 1f-g). The M
3
 spectral data indicate that 

the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface 

east of it slightly exceeds 1 µm. The 2 µm absorption is 

quite flat while the 1 µm absorption is shifted towards 

higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for 

olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to 

glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-

cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-

ture was identified.  

The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in 

the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their 

strong 2 µm absorptions and extremely weak or absent 

1 µm absorptions.  

     Results and discussion: The environs of the dome 

present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-

dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and 

graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, 

pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 

1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-

denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset 

it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-

tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile 

dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to 

the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the 

dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that 

extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley 

Formation terrain and across the western part of the 

dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as 

a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a 

magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended 

to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the 

bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-

mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-

tion between volcanic products and the surface may 

occur through the fractures that form to allow the 

graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive 

processes, including pyroclastic material, might be 

involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but 

not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic 

phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-

amined lunar region may even have formed completely 

independent of each other. The fact that the examined 

dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-

ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-

matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by 

a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-

lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] 

yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma 

pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome 

SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-

duced in [9-10].

ON  THE  VARIATIONS  OF  GALACTIC  COSMIC  RAYS  DURING  THE  LAST  BILLION  YEARS.

Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of 

cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv 

[1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays 

(GCR) varied with a period of 143 ± 10 Myr due to 

periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral 

arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this 

period is equal to 147 ± 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-

clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-

er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the 

ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of 

ages from the available data set. We compared ob-

tained results with results for the model set of ages 

assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-

tions.  

Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 

82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were 

taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to 

paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we 

used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-

tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-

gram 2). 

Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-

ed values of ages was made by means of calculating 

the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of 

parameters of the distribution of these values. For each 

value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was 

calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). 

Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages 

and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity 

of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 

1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-

lated the population characteristics of the distribution 

of phase values: dispersion S
2
, kurtosis Ek and χ

2
. This 

procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 

200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each 

characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. 

Results for the χ2 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we 

can see: (a) changes of χ2 for the corrected ages of iron 

meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random 

"true" values of ages, assuming no variations of the 

GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR 

variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same 

on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 

450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with 

such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 

2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the χ2 values 

for t ~ 400-500 Myr (Δ2 = -44 ± 4 %) and less con-

vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (Δ1 = -46 ± 13 %). 

Also, similar deviations from the mean values were 

obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-

persion S
2 
and kurtosis Ek. 

Distribution of the model set of 100 values of 

"true" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-

bution of the "measured" values of ages will be the 

same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the 

last billion years has not changed. Distribution of 

"measured" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 

4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied 

with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution 

is significantly different from the distribution of ages 

of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of 

the "measured" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the 

same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites 

(Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR 

intensity variations of 450 Myr. 

Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-

istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of 

~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-

iations may be due to periodic passing solar system 

through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 

8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 

Myr are less certain.

EFFECTS OF SECONDARY PROCESSING ON PRESOLAR GRAIN ABUNDANCES AND 
COMPOSITIONS IN THE UNIQUE CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITE MILLER RANGE 07687. C. Floss1 
and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis,

Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered 

or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest 
degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous 
alteration [1–3], and have been found in abundance 
only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a 
result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular 
and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. 

MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but 
contains unique features that distinguish it from typical 
CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of 
refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO 
chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and 
fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in 
COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. 
However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is 
that it appears to have undergone a unique style of 
highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix 
is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped 
Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions 
separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).  

 
Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix 
from MIL 07687. 

In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high 
abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in 
fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous 
silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in 
MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the 
abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the 
matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the 
secondary alteration it has experienced. 

Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 
50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix 
areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees 
of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 
33,900 µm2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich 

altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively 
unaltered Fe-poor matrix. 

Following isotopic identification of the grains, we 
used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major 
element compositions of the grains, following standard 
procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. 

Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar 
grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 
110 ± 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 ± 19 ppm for 
SiC, in good agreement with the abundances 
determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains 
belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains 
have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to 
as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2). 

 
Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich 

presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other 
data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. 

Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all 
of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide 
grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly 
consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with 
Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or 
pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. 
Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 
at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges 
and medians observed for presolar silicates from 
primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 
and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 
[e.g., 1 and references therein]. 

Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of 
MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing 
silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 

1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)



other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites 
(Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are 
extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe 
oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or 
akaganéite [7, 8]. 

 
Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-

poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from 
MIL 07687. 

The results of our imaging survey indicate that 
presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-
poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the 
aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not 
resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. 
However, we do see some differences in the presolar 
grain abundances between the two types of matrix. 
Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-
poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 
1000 µm2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 
grains per 1000 µm2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. 
Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are 
again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered 
ones. However, the difference is not as large as might 
be expected given that presolar silicates are more 
susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar 
grain types. 

In addition to the difference in abundance, we 
observe compositional differences in the presolar 
silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains 
from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content 
than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 

at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the 
ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which 
have a factor of two higher median Fe content than 
presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. 
In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx 
of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing 
experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe 
content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix 
areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this 
case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of 
Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and 
subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides. 

 
Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains 

per 1000 µm2) in MIL 07687. 
Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the 

SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix 
areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 µm2. This difference 
is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more 
resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate 
grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact 
that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are 
the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix 
areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly 
oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to 
the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those 
matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration.

IDENTIFICATION OF IMPACT CRATERS IN ALUMINUM FOIL FROM THE STARDUST 
INTERSTELLAR DUST COLLECTOR: AN UPDATE. C. Floss. Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics 
Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu) 

 
Introduction: In addition to the first unambiguous 

cometary samples, from comet 81P/Wild 2 [1], 
NASA’s Stardust mission was designed to collect the 
first samples of contemporary interstellar dust. The 
Stardust interstellar dust collector collected particles 
for 229 days during two exposures prior to the 
spacecraft encounter with Wild 2 and tracked the 
interstellar dust stream for all but 34 days of that time. 
The Al foils make up ~15% of the total collection 
surface and about 12-15 particles, with 2/3 of those 
less than ~1 µm in size, were expected to have 
impacted the available Al foil area. 

The initial investigation of these samples took 
place under the auspices of the CAPTEM-approved 
Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE). 
The ISPE proposed to carry out non-destructive, non-
invasive searches for, and analyses of, interstellar dust 
candidates in the Stardust interstellar tray and focused 
on two parallel investigations: extraction and analysis 
of tracks in aerogel identified through Stardust@home, 
and search for and characterization of impact craters in 
the aluminum foils [2].  

The work of the ISPE team resulted in the 
discovery and characterization of seven probable  
interstellar dust particles [3], four of which were 
identified from impact craters in the Al foil [4]. At the 
formal conclusion of the ISPE two years ago, only 
~5% of the available Al foil area had been measured. 
We have continued the work of scanning Al foils from 
the Stardust interstellar tray in order to identify 
additional interstellar dust candidates. Here we report 
the results of our work to date. 

Experimental: Foil scanning is done in automated 
mode using the JEOL 840a SEM at Washington 
University. By combining our instrument control 
software with custom written software, we are able to 
automatically map an entire foil in a single (long) run. 
Foils are divided into multiple grids of about 0.25 
mm2. Manual z-axis focusing is done in the center of 
each region, after which the grids are further divided 
into individual images 106 x 80 µm in size. The z-axis 
positions are interpolated from one grid center to the 
next to ensure good focus for all individual images in a 
grid and the x, y, and z coordinates are individually 
stored. The images are mapped at 15 kV, 5 nA for 10 
sec per frame, providing a resolution of ~50 nm/pixel 
with a dwell time of 0.001 sec/µm2. The entire array is 
imaged automatically in sequence, and each image is 
saved with a unique label identifying its position on the 
foil.  

Images from the foils (~5000 for short foils and 
~10,000 for long foils) are manually examined 
independently by at least two undergraduate students, 
and the candidate craters identified are subsequently 
ranked. The most likely candidates are then imaged at 
higher resolution to ascertain which are actual impact 
craters. 

Results: We have scanned a total of four long (N) 
foils and two short (W) foils: 1010N, 1031N, 1032W, 
1047N, 1061N and 1063W. Image examination is still 
in progress on foil 1010N, but we have identified a 
feature on this foil that appears to be an unusually 
large impact crater (Fig. 1). However, additional 
analysis (e.g., Auger spectroscopy and/or FIB/TEM) 
will be needed to confirm the identification. A similar 
feature found on foil 1047N during the ISPE ultimately 
turned out to be a hole created during the foil flattening 
process [4]. 

 
Figure 1. Secondary electron image 314@43 from 

interstellar foil 1010N,1. The impact feature is 
approximately 4 µm in diameter. 

Approximately 2700 candidate craters were 
identified from the other foils, of which 1125 were 
selected for higher resolution imaging. Table 1 shows 
the resulting 19 likely impact craters. Eleven of these 
were investigated as part of the ISPE [4]; the 
remaining eight are shown in Fig. 2. While some are 
clear impact craters, others are more ambiguous and, 
like 314@43 mentioned above, will require additional 
analysis for confirmation. 

Outlook:  The number of impact craters identified 
on individual foils is clearly highly variable and the 
foils examined by our laboratory as part of the ISPE 
fortuitously contained a relatively high proportion of 
craters. Moreover, many of the potential new impact 

1005.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)



features shown in Fig. 2 are unconventional compared 
to ‘traditional craters’ and it remains to be seen 
whether compositional analyses can confirm an 
extraterrestrial or even secondary impact origin for 
these features. Despite these obstacles, the results of 
the ISPE demonstrate that continued scanning and 
examination of the Al foils on the interstellar collector 
has the potential to provide important new information 
about contemporary interstellar dust.

ELLESMERE ISLAND AS AN ANALOG OF KASEI VALLES, MARS: LANDSCAPES RESULTING 
FROM LARGE-SCALE SELECTIVE LINEAR EROSION OF SUB-POLAR ICE SHEETS. 
John D. Arfstrom, jarfstrom@gmail.com, www.JohnArfstrom.com, 904.200.2619. 

Introduction: Terrestrial anastomosing glacial 
troughs and streamlined landforms matching the ideal-
ly formed channel systems of Mars are lacking. The 
disparate geology and topography of Earth and Mars 
may well have variably influenced the erosion of such 
landforms, which are probably more ideally formed on 
Mars due to the spatial uniformity and erodibility of 
the wide expanses of crater scarred, pristine regolith 
plains. Likewise, the circular ramparts that craters 
present against the onslaught of erosion, compared to 
the random forms typical on Earth, would be reflected 
in the geometries of eroded forms. An important ques-
tion to be addressed is: how would ice sheet-generated 
landscapes on Earth appear if not influenced by pre-
existing channeling, topography, and structure of 
bedrock? Considering the morphology of Kasei Valles, 
might regolith have supported the generation of its 
ideally-shaped streamlined landforms akin to the well-
formed islands of glacial spillways, yet through the 
processes of large-scale glacial erosion evidenced by 
its extant areal scour indicative of wet-based erosion? 

Discussion: There are examples of terrestrial ice 
sheet-generated landforms for which landscape consid-
erations might explain the above mentioned disparity.  
Fig. 1a shows Kasei Valles, an erosional landform net-
work comprised of interconnected or anastomosing 
channels or troughs, supposedly breached and non-
breached streamlined landforms, and valley-wide areal 
scour. Thought to be a flood or glacial spillway chan-
nel system, Kasei Valles is here interpreted as a set of 
glacial troughs and streamlined landforms, likely erod-
ed by sub-polar ice sheets [1]. A terrestrial analog can 
be seen in Fig. 1b. It shows a portion of eastern 
Ellesmere Island recently exposed by the retreating ice 
sheet where several streamlined landforms are visible 
among a network of interconnected glacial troughs. 
Though the landforms at Kasei Valles are more curvi-
linear, whereas more angular at Ellesmere, this could 
be explained by the uniform and easily eroded regolith, 
compared to the structured and resistant bedrock. 

Also, the widespread areal scour at Kasei Valles 
(Fig. 2), which extends over most streamlined forms, is 
more consistent with the uniform areal scour typical of 
ice sheets than the more spatially variable and local-
ized erosion typical of the generally more focused ero-
sion caused by floods. This is because the pressure 
melting point within ice sheets (see explanation below) 
promotes sheet-like erosion, except where geologic 
and topographic factors promote channelization.  

The erosion of the exposed landscape at Ellesmere 
Island occurred at the base of the nearby ice sheet be-
fore it retreated. Although related to intermediate-scale 
asymmetric and symmetric erosional landforms such 
as roches mountennees, whalebacks, rock drumlins, 
and crag and tails, the scale of the landforms are more 
consistent with “large-scale selective linear erosion” 
associated with sub-polar ice sheets, which are cold-
based where thinner and warm-based where thick 
enough [1]. Ice streams within the ice sheet slid across 
the bedrock with varying velocities, both spatially and 
temporally, to erode the anastomosing network of 
troughs. Although inundated by the ice sheet, the 
streamlined landforms were marked by relatively less 
basal sliding and erosion than the troughs, having been 
overlain by thinner, slower moving or stagnant cold-
based ice. Similarly, “non-breached” streamlined land-
forms at Kasei Valles may have been inundated by 
cold-based ice, but were spared the erosion evidenced 
by the areal scour of adjacent lower topography. 

The causes of these spatial variations of erosion are 
better understood if one imagines the pressure melting 
point, where sliding may occur, as a dynamic, 3-di-
mensional layer at depth, controlled by ice thickness   
and basal and flow variations [1, 2]. Erosion principal-
ly occurs beneath thicker ice where the pressure melt-
ing point is met, where warmed by geothermal heat 
flux, frictional heating, and through heat transfer by 
water. As erosion continues, enhanced by positive 
feedback through increasing frictional heating and ice 
thickness, subglacial troughs lengthen, widen, deepen, 
and even connect, influenced by parameters such as 
topography, pre-existing channelling, and faults. Also, 
as ice flows from a given area, the ice thins and the 
pressure melting point may drop below the ground 
surface, causing sliding to cease and flow velocities to 
decrease in that area. These positive and negative 
feedback mechanisms cause an ice sheet to maintain a 
sheet like flow, yet erode troughs where velocities are 
highest. Anastomosing of troughs result from long-
term fluctuations in ice drainage patterns within an ice 
sheet, represented by linked-flow networks or evolving 
or switching time-transgressive flow patterns.  

In line with these considerations and other morpho-
logical interpretations, including those previously pre-
sented elsewhere [3, 4, 5], I argue for a sub-polar ice 
sheet-based interpretation of Kasei Valles, in which 
variable and widespread erosion induced areal scour 
and stripped regolith to leave behind its streamlined

gin of Kasei Valles is related globally to other valley 
systems on Mars in an previous abstract and an associ-
ated poster paper, which outlines ongoing research [6].

Effusive Lunar Domes Near Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F: Morphometry and Mode of formation. P. 

Lazzarotti.1 and R. Lena2 - Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Pernice 71, 54100 Massa, Italy; paolo@lazzarotti-
hires.com; 2Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it;.  

      Introduction: Lunar mare domes are smooth low 

features with gentle convex upward profiles. In this 

contribution we provide an analysis of three effusive 

domes located in the eastern lunar regions near crater 

Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F, which have 

previously not been examined in detail. The first 

examined dome is located at longitude 25.44º E and 

latitude 52.24º N with a base diameter of 6.0 km (Fig. 

1). It is a previously unreported dome, which we 

named Aristoteles 1 (Aris1). Another dome, bisected 

by Rimae Daniell, located at 24.86° E and 38.45° N 

and having a diameter of 9 km, has been termed Plana 

G1 (P1). It displays three protrusions which probably 

are pre-existing non-volcanic hills. The third examined 

dome is situated to the north of P1 and to the east of 

Plana F, at longitude 39.32° E and latitude 13.50° N, 

and has a diameter of 7 km (Fig. 2, dome termed P2).  

     Spectral properties: For both domes, Clementine  

UVVIS spectral data indicate a R415/R750 ratio of about  

0.56-0.57 indicating basalts of low TiO2 content and 

furthermore reveal a 750 nm reflectance of R750 = 0.13 

for P1-P2 and 0.16 for Aris1, and a weak mafic 

absorption for two domes in Lacus Somniorum with 

R950/R750 = 1.06, suggesting a high soil maturity. The 

dome Aris1 has a lower R950/R750 ratio of 1.01 (Fig. 3).

domes P1 and P2 are typical representatives of 

rheologic group R3. Hence, for three examined domes 

the magma reservoirs are located well below the lunar 

crust regarding the thicknesses of the total crust of 

about 55 km [7].

Introduction: Olympus Mons and the Tharsis 

Montes are some the largest volcanoes on Mars and 

in our Solar System. Our team is funded by NASA’s 

Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP) to complete a 

set of 1:1,000,000 geologic maps of Olympus, Arsia, 

Pavonis, and Ascraeus based on the mapping style 

defined by [1,2]. Figure 1 shows the area around 

each volcano that we are funded to map, including 

additional sections that cover the rift aprons and 

small vent fields. Detailed mapping of a limited area 

of these volcanoes revealed a diverse distribution of 

volcanic landforms within the calderas, and along the 

flanks, rift aprons, and surrounding plains [1]. Here, 

we report on the progress of each map.

ries (solid lines) for each map and extensions (dashed 

lines) to cover rift aprons and small vent fields. 

 

Data and Methods: We are mapping each vol-

cano in ArcMap 9 and 10.2 to produce digital geo-

logic maps at 1:1,000,000 map scale for the USGS. A 

Context Camera (CTX) mosaic serves as the primary 

basemap, supplemented by High Resolution Stereo 

Camera (HRSC), THEMIS daytime IR, HiRISE, and 

Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data. To ad-

dress our science questions we have conducted our 

mapping at ~1:300,000 to ~1:100,000 on the CTX 

basemap. This scale enables us to distinguish be-

tween different morphologic features like sinuous 

rilles, leveed channels, low shields, and surface tex-

tures (hummocky, mottled, smooth), plus we are able 

to determine flow margins, flow directions, and strat-

igraphic relationships between different eruption 

sequences. Our primary objective for each map is to 

show the areal extent, distribution, and stratigraphic 

relationships of the different volcanic morphologies 

to better understand the changes in effusive style 

across each volcano and provide insight into the 

similarities and differences in their evolution. 

Mapping Progress: Each map is in a different 

stage of the geologic mapping process. The Ascraeus 

Mons map is the most recently funded project and we 

will begin preliminary mapping in 2015. The maps of 

Arsia and Pavonis Montes are also nearing comple-

tion and should be ready to submit for publication by 

mid to late 2015 (Fig. 2). The Olympus Mons map 

has complete line work and is being prepared for 

submission to the USGS for publication (Fig. 3). For 

the Tharsis Montes, our objective this year is to map 

the contacts between different volcanic provinces on 

each volcano (e.g., main shield, rift aprons, and lava 

plains). We have mapped the surficial fan deposits on 

Pavonis and Arsia Mons using sketch maps from [4-

6] as guides for mapping similar units (e.g., smooth, 

ridged, knobby). See Dapremont et al., this meeting 

[Abstract #1605] for detailed mapping of the Arsia 

Mons fan shaped deposit.

Discussion:  Our current progress has provided sev-

eral insights into the eruption processes and evolu-

tion of these volcanoes. 

Geologic Units: The current mapping units have 

evolved from the original proposed mapping units to 

correspond with units used for the recent geologic 

map of Olympus Mons [6] (Fig. 3).  Detailed image-

ry from CTX has allowed us to diversify the units 

based on various eruption styles. The units are dis-

tinguished primarily by morphology and are grouped 

for each edifice (main shield, rift apron, fan deposit, 

lava plains). 

General Formation Sequence: Mapping reveals a 

similar sequence of events for the evolution of the 

three Tharsis Montes volcanoes [1,2,8]: 1) main 

shield forms, 2) eruptions from the NE/SW rifts em-

place long lava flows that surround the main flank, 3) 

eruptions wane and build up the rift aprons and 

shield fields, 4) glaciers deposit surficial fan deposit 

material [9], and 5) localized recent eruptions along 

the main flanks, in the calderas, and within the fan-

shaped deposits. Further mapping will reveal the 

relative geologic timing of eruptive units on the main 

shields and provide a more complete analysis of the 

spatial distribution of tube-fed versus channel-fed 

flows for each volcano and how they compare with 

Olympus Mons as originally discussed by [1].

Introduction: Lunar sinuous rilles are thought to 

have formed by thermal erosion, mechanical erosion, 

construction, or a combination of these processes via 

emplacement by lava tubes and/or lava channels [1-4]. 

The investigation of Hadley Rille by Apollo 15 pro-

vided the first field observations of a rille, including 

outcrops of stratigraphic layers within the far rille wall  

[5]. High-resolution remote sensing data sets from 

NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter allow for the 

identification of smaller volcanic features, outcrops, 

layers, and detailed topographic measurements at the 

meter-scale [6,7]. Several questions relate to layers 

observed in the rille walls including: 1) What is their 

stratigraphic sequence and can individual flows be 

defined? 2) Are the layers a sequence of multiple, old-

er eruptions that have been thermally eroded? 3) 

Which layers are related to the eruption that formed 

the rille? Each visible lineation that defines a layer, 

may not be a surface contact between individual flows, 

therefore 4) How can individual flows be distinguished 

within the stratigraphic sequence? and 5) What flow 

processes can be recognized based on characteristics 

of the wall rock (inflated pahoehoe) [8]?      

Terrestrial volcanic features with similar morphol-

ogies to lunar rilles can provide insight into their for-

mation on the Moon. While the scale of most lunar 

rilles are much larger than their terrestrial counterparts, 

there are several examples similar in scale to ones we 

have documented in Idaho. The SSERVI FINESSE 

team (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System Sci-

ence and Exploration) [9] conducted field studies at 

Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve 

(COTM) in Idaho from July 28 – Aug. 8, 2014 to in-

vestigate terrestrial analogs for lunar volcanic and im-

pact features [10]. Here, we compare field observa-

tions at Inferno Chasm (Figs. 1,2), a rille-like channel 

in Idaho to Isis (Fig. 3), a similar sized rille on the 

Moon.  

Inferno Chasm (42°58’00”N, 113°11’25”W) is a 

basaltic low-shield with a vent and sinuous channel 

(Fig. 1). The area is overgrown with sage and desert 

grasses, but it appears that the margins of the low 

shield have been embayed or buried by subsequent 

lava flows or loess making it difficult to define the true 

extent of this volcanic feature and locate lava deposits 

beyond the end of the channel. 

 

 
Figure 1. Inferno Chasm in Idaho. (A) Location of Differen-

tial GPS and LiDAR surveys [Google Earth]. (B) Morpho-

logic sketch map of key flow features and structures.   
 
We documented the geology and morphology of 

Inferno Chasm using a Riegl Vz-400 LiDAR, a Trim-

ble R8 and TopCon Hiper II Differential Global Posi-

tioning Systems (DGPS) (Fig. 2), Unmanned Aerial 

Vehicles (UAV), and sampling. The main vent crater 

is roughly circular and is ~200 m wide, ~20 m deep 

and has a small 2.5 m-high mound in the center (Fig. 

2). DGPS survey D-D’ shows that the sinuous channel 

extends to the west while dropping ~10 m over ~1700 

m, yielding a slope of -0.005° (Fig. 2). Several over-

flow channels are also visible in the remote sensing 

images (Fig. 1B), but are subtle in the field. For exam-

ple, DGPS profile C-C’ is 350 m long, 30 m wide, and 

2-5 m deep. Outcrops of the vent walls expose massive 

layers 2-3 m thick with textures that suggest highly 

welded spatter overlain by a 1-2 m thick sequence of 

thinner layers (overspills, shelley, gaseous blisters) 

each 10s of cm thick. Field observations and samples 

collected indicate low-shield development typical of 

the Eastern Snake River Plains [11].

Lunar Rilles: Isis, a rille in Serenitatis Basin 

(19°N, 27.5°E) (Fig. 3) has a similar morphology to 

Inferno Chasm. The feature is ~1.3 km wide and ~60-

70 m high at the vent. The channel is ~3 km long, 283 

m-wide, and 25 m deep [7]. The rille is located within 

high-Ti basalts and there are no identifiable deposits 

extending from the end of the channel. The vent is 

aligned with three other small cones along a north-

west-southeast trending graben, possibly related to an 

intrusive dike. There are boulders present along the 

rim of the rille, but no distinct layers are visible in the 

images. 

 
Figure 2. Differential GPS profiles A-A’ across the vent 
(North to South) and D-D’ along the channel floor (East to 
West) of Inferno Chasm (see Fig. 1A). 
 

Discussion: Field observations of the wall material 

at Inferno Chasm suggest the feature was constructed 

through a combination of thin lava overflow, rheo-

morphic flow of congealed spatter, and intense weld-

ing of deeper parts, with or without additional lava 

injection, to form the thick, massive layers. Evidence 

of thermal erosion and/or lava tube collapse along the 

channel were not identified, but have not been ruled 

out. Distinct levees were not identified along the chan-

nel margin, but there are linear, topographic highs near 

the mouth of the channel (Fig. 1B).  

Isis has several similarities in both morphology and 

scale to Inferno Chasm. Both are topographic highs 

with a central channel ~2-3 km long. No distal depos-

its are identified beyond each channel. Isis is atypical 

compared to larger sinuous rilles, like the example in 

Marius Hills shown in Fig. 3B. Most lunar rilles ap-

pear to carve into the local terrain through thermal 

erosion [7]. We suggest Isis was formed by construc-

tion, from a highly gaseous, fire fountain eruption that 

created spatter that collected to form the cone and spat-

ter-fed flows rather than by thermal erosion. Observa-

tions of flow textures in exposed layers and rocks can 

help interpret the flow processes that formed the rilles 

[8]. For example, the planar, vesicle horizons observed 

in rocks along the rim of Hadley Rille are consistent 

with inflated pahoehoe [8], whereas the tumultuous 

textures observed in the boulders and wall rock at In-

ferno Chasm are consistent with welded spatter. How-

ever, given the much larger scale of most lunar rilles, 

construction may only be a minor component of their 

formation. Based on the depth of a rille, assumptions 

on how much the wall represents eroded substrate ma-

terial and which layers formed via construction is im-

portant for determining parameters for thermal erosion 

models.

Dramatic Change in Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.  A. A. Simon1, M. H. Wong2, J. H. Rogers3, G. S. Orton4, I. de

Introduction:  Jupiter’s Great Red Spot (GRS) is 

one of its most distinct and enduring features, having 
been continuously observed since the 1800’s.  It cur-
rently spans the smallest latitude and longitude size 
ever recorded.  Here we show analyses of 2014 Hubble 
spectral imaging data to study the color, structure and 
internal dynamics of this long-live storm. 

Physical Dimensions: The GRS’s red edges have 
contracted from a longitude length of ~21° during the 
Voyager flybys in 1979 to ~15.5° in Hubble data ac-
quired in 2012, shrinking on average 0.19°/year over 
the modern era [1]. Amateur observers documented a 
sudden decrease in longitudinal extent in early 2014, 
faster than the average rate of contraction, and Hubble 
Space Telescope time was granted to characterize the 
current state of the storm.  In the 2014 Hubble data, the 
red edges of the spot span about 14.1° in longitude, a 
decrease of 1.4° (1760 km) in 21 months, a rate of 
change four times greater than typical since 1979.   

The GRS’s latitudinal size has been much more 
constant, historically spanning between 10.5° and 11°, 
and is currently 9.4°, the smallest size measured to 
date.  There has been a slight overall trend toward lati-
tude shrinkage of 0.04°/year, significantly slower than 
in the longitude dimension, but the fastest change of 
0.7° occurred between 2012 and 2014.  Though the 
storm has a clearly diminishing length-to-width aspect 
ratio, from 1.8 in the Voyager era (and much greater 
historically) to 1.5 currently.

edges, which are somewhat subjective, are often used 
to mark its size.  Amateur measurements (red) show 
scatter, but are consistent with spacecraft data. Dynam-
ical measures of the narrower high velocity collar also 
show a trend towards smaller size.

1995, 2009, and 2014.  Colors have been arbitrarily 
enhanced for consistency. 

 
Spectral Analysis: Another notable characteristic 

of the 2014 images is the deep red color of the GRS, 
which is normally seen only during climatic cycles 
when the adjacent South Equatorial Belt (SEB) “fades” 
or whitens, such as during the Pioneer flybys in 1974 

[2].  Spectroscopy was performed using Hubble imag-
es from 1995 to 2014 to determine the visible color of 
the darkest core of the storm, Fig. 3.  In this region, the 
reflectance spectrum (I/F) is fairly constant [3,4].  The 
greatest change of up to 0.08 in I/F can be seen near 
410 nm when comparing data from 1995 and 2008.  
The data acquired in 2014, however, show that the 
spectrum of the GRS is depressed by 0.1 to 0.15 in I/F 
at all wavelengths shorter than 500 nm.  In addition, 
reflectance in the 890-nm methane gas absorption band 
has increased by ~0.11 in I/F since 2009, using the 
same filter, implying the altitudes and/or the concen-
trations of upper tropospheric aerosols have increased 

[5]. Spectra of other red regions on the planet do not 
show simultaneous increases in methane-band reflec-

tivity and visible reddening, ruling out calibration is-
sues.  Spectral change is also obvious in the core of the 
GRS; ratio images indicate that the spectral slope from 
630 to 500 nm has steepened in 2014 compared with 
previous dates over most of the GRS.

Figure 3. Spectral Imaging from Hubble shows dra-
matic change in brightness and slope in 2014. 
 

Winds: The internal wind speed of the GRS can 
top 150 m/s, in a high-velocity collar that is smaller the 
visual diameter of the storm [1,6,7].  Automated veloc-
ity field extraction was attempted from the 2014 data, 
using the ACCIV method with correlations calculated 
for box sizes of 5° in latitude/longitude, between pairs 
of velocity field advected images [6].  The quality of 
the extracted velocity field was insufficient to accu-
rately constrain the location and magnitude of the 
high-speed collar around the vortex due to limitations 
of the imaging data, e.g., the shadow of Ganymede 
over the western side of the vortex in the later three 
frames resulted in only tie point pairs from short 43-
min separations over large parts of the GRS rather than 
10 hours.  The eastern area of later frames in both or-
bits also suffered from reduced contrast due to proxim-
ity to Jupiter’s limb.   We identify tangential velocities 
in the 100–150 m/s range, with higher speeds at the 
north-south extrema of the vortex, where it interacts 
with zonal jets, but with larger uncertainties than typi-
cal.  Thus, preliminary manual and automated meas-
urements of cloud motions showed no significant in-
crease in wind speed when compared with winds 
measured from 1996 to 2006 [1,6,7], implying an in-
ternal circulation period of about 3.2 days. 

Wind Jet Interactions: The sudden shrinkage of 
the GRS and its observed color change are likely to be 
in response to changes in jet interactions. The reduc-
tion in width is due to shifts of both the northern edge 
(latitude mean 1979-2012, 16.8° S +/-0.3; 2014, 17.4° 
S) and the south edge (latitude mean 1979-2012, 27.4° 

S +/-0.2; 2014, 26.8° S).  This causes reduced deflec-
tion of the jets north and south of the GRS, altering the 
zonal wind shear environment sensed by the vortex.  
Decreased interaction with small vortices carried by 
those wind jets may be the reason for the intensified 
red color in 2014.  In particular, the GRS is now suffi-
ciently withdrawn from the westward jet at 19.5° S that 
it does not ingest vortices carried by that jet.  Similar-
ly, during SEB fading events there are no vortices be-
ing carried by the jet toward the GRS and its color 
intensifies [2,8]. 

 
Conclusions:	   The GRS interacts with the zonal 

wind jets, with energy or momentum exchange of un-
known magnitude. It is not yet understood what colors 
the clouds and why they can vary in spectral slope and 
absolute brightness, though the current spectrum may 
be indicating a change in colored-particle production.  
Further analyses of the temperatures, winds, and size 
of the GRS, especially in epochs of change, will pro-
vide interesting constraints to analytic models of geo-
strophic balance in the region.  In addition, global cir-
culation modeling of the GRS in its flow field for dif-
ferent dates will show which configurations are most 
stable to decay.

WET-TO-DRY HYDROLOGICAL TRANSITION ENCAPSULATED IN FLUVIAL STRATIGRAPHY OF 

AEOLIS DORSA, MARS.  R. E. Jacobsen

University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA 37996 

(RJacobse@vols.utk.edu and dburr1@utk.edu). 

 

Background:  The geomorphology of precipita-

tion-fed fluvial activity suggests a transition from 

wetter conditions to drier conditions in martian history 

[1 & refs. therein]. The Aeolis Dorsa (AD) region, 

located between Aeolis and Zephyria Plana and south 

of the Cerberus lavas [2], contains numerous sinuous 

ridges and fans interpreted to be inverted fluvial 

deposits [e.g., 3-8]. These deposits, when arranged 

stratigraphically, are a microcosm of martian fluvial 

history [cf. 7]. In addition to a rich fluvial history, the 

region has experienced burial by volcanic ash and/or 

aeolian deposits of the Medusae Fossae Formation 

(MFF), exhumation through aeolian abrasion, forming 

yardangs [9 & refs. therein], and topographic 

modification by collapse or tectonic processes [5]. 

The most common inverted fluvial features are flat-

topped sinuous ridges and ridge networks [3]. Some 

ridges have semi-concentric lineations similar to 

terrestrial meander deposits, which on Earth, generally 

require more steady hydrologic conditions [10]. These 

deposits have been interpreted as scroll-bars [3] or 

laterally aggrading channel beds of meandering rivers 

[8]. Inverted fluvial features imply some inurdation [4 

& refs. therein], likely by geochemical cementation, 

followed by erosion of host MFF [4]. Thin sinuous 

ridges, some of which appear stacked above flat-

topped inverted fluvial features, have been interpreted 

as inverted paleochannels from a second episode of 

fluvial activity [3,4,6]. The fan-shaped features 

connect to inverted paleochannels or paleochannel 

networks, and have been interpreted as alluvial fans 

[3,7], which on Earth have intermittent flows and 

“flashy” discharges [11]. 

Hypothesis:  Previous analyses [e.g., 3-8] suggest 

the following sequence of events for the formation of 

AD. (a) Long-duration, meandering rivers deposited 

sediments within valleys at least a few kilometers 

wide. (b) MFF deposits infilled these river valleys. (c) 

Sinuous but narrower rivers exploited some of the 

same river valleys, depositing sediment within these 

(stratigraphically higher) channels. (d) Fluvial sedi-

ments from both (a) and (c) were indurated. (e) River 

valley walls (MFF) were eroded, resulting in topo-

graphic inversion of (a) and (c). (f) Relief developed 

along the interior margins of Aeolis and Zephyria Pla-

na. (g) Alluvial fans formed along interior margins. (h) 

Fans became indurated. (i) MFF deposits covered the 

region. (j) Exhumation and erosion inverted the (indu-

rated) fans and revealed the (previously inverted) flu-

vial features of (a) and (c). (k) Local to sub-regional 

deformation (e.g., by collapse or tectonism) occurred. 

The transition from wetter to drier conditions are in-

ferred from the deposits of events (a), (c), and (g). 

Methods:  To test the geographical extent of this 

hypothesis, stratigraphies were made and compared 

among geospatially distributed locations, Area 45N 

and Area 40 (Figure 1). Hypothesis testing required 

images from the Context Camera (CTX) [12], High 

Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) 

[13], and topography from CTX digital terrian models, 

derived from Ames Stereo Pipeline [14]. Boundaries 

for geomorphological units were delinated in ArcMap 

software. Interpretations of inverted fluvial features, 

lava units, and yardangs were based on previous inter-

pretations described in the background [2-9]. 

 
Figure 1: Black boxes mark locations for geomorphological 

and stratal observations presented here, and previously [6]. 

Results: Area 45N:  Flat-topped ridges, consistent 

with broad deposits of inverted fluvial channels or flu-

vial valleys [3,4], are hosted within the lowest unit (fd) 

(Figure 2). A superposed thin ridge, interpreted as an 

inverted fluvial channel, points to later deposition of a 

subsequent fluvial unit (fct). This stacked assemblage 

indicates two episodes of fluvial activity. NW-SE-

oriented yardangs cross-cut thin inverted channels 

(unit fct), cover inverted fluvial deposits (unit fd) and 

intra-ridge areas, indicating that units fct and fd were 

inverted, covered by MFF, and later eroded by aeolian 

abrasion. An alluvial fan grades into NW-SE yardangs 

that superpose unit fd, indicating that the fan formed in 

a unit (af) deposited with or after deposition of MFF. 

1011.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)





Area 40:  Flat ridges with interior, semi-concentric 

curved ridges, consistent with inverted fluvial meander 

deposits [3,4,8], are hosted within unit fm (Figure 3). 

Narrower flat ridges, consistent with flat-topped in-

verted fluvial channels [3,4], are hosted within unit fcf. 

Unit fm cross-cuts unit fcf, indicating that unit fcf is 

older than unit fm. A unit of thin inverted fluvial chan-

nels (fct) superposes unit fm, indicating a third period 

of fluvial activity and subsequent inversion. A mound-

forming unit (mu) has many small craters, and troughs 

that terminate at a unit of fans (af), indicating a fourth 

period of fluvial activity. 

Discussion:  The formation of Area 45N is similar 

to the hypothesis. Deviations from the hypothesis oc-

cur in events (a), because evidence for meandering 

(i.e., semi-concentric lineations) is lacking, and event 

(k), since no evidence of deformation is observed [5]. 

The stratigraphic history in Area 40 differs from the 

hypothesis. Older paleochannels of unit fcf indicate 

that, depending on location, event (a) may consist of 

one or more stratal units (i.e., members). Troughs in 

unit mu that lead to fans (af) also differ from the hy-

pothesis. In Area 40, relief was created along unit mu, 

followed by precipitation, run-off, sediment transport, 

and deposition. In many other areas of AD, including 

Area 45N, the host unit for the fans (unit mu) has been 

eroded, leaving inverted paleochannels and fans. 

Conclusions:  The transition from wetter to drier 

hydrological conditions is preserved in the stratigraphy 

of Aeolis Dorsa, beginning with fluvial deposits of 

greater hydrologic stability (e.g., meander deposits in 

Area 40 and integrated fluvial channels or valleys in 

45N) and ending with hydrologically intermittent allu-

vial fans in both areas.  

Measurements of paleochannel morphology by area 

and stratal unit will be coupled with scaled form-

discharge relationships [4,7,15 & refs. therein] to esti-

mate paleodischarge through time.

PRELIMINARY ANALYSES OF MARTIAN-TERRESTRIAL ANALOG RIVERS TO EXAMINE THE 

INFLUENCE OF SEDIMENT IN FORM-DISCHARGE RELATIONSHIPS.  R. E. Jacobsen

Background:  Empirical form-discharge relation-

ships derived from terrestrial rivers [e.g., 1,2] and 

scaled for difference in gravity, are commonly used to 

estimate flow discharges (m
3
 s

-1
) of Martian pale-

ochannels [e.g., 3-7]. Discharge estimates are used in 

various models with implications for ancient climate 

[8-9]. Regression analyses of terrestrial channel form 

(e.g., width, wavelength) and discharge records pro-

duce form-discharge relationships: Qn=aX
b
, where Q 

is the discharge of a flood with a recurrence interval of 

n number of years, a and b are constants, and X is a 

measurement of form [1-2]. Bankfull discharge is rec-

ognized as the most effective flow for moving channel 

sediment over time, controlling channel form, and may 

be approximated by the Q2yr [10]. 

Sediment size in the channel bed and banks has 

profound effect on the relationship between discharge 

and channel form [1]. Form-discharge relationships not 

specific to any category of sediment size (Table 1), 

refered to here as “non-specific” relationships, were 

derived from regression analysis of 252 channels with 

various sediment sizes (clays to cobbles) in the Mis-

souri River Basin [1]. Equation 1 is the most common-

ly used relationship for estimating paleodischarge on 

Mars [3-7] because there is a dearth of information 

about fluvial channel sediments [11 & refs. therein]. 

Relationships derived from channels with specific sed-

iment sizes, refered to here as “sediment-specific” rela-

tionships, are derived from analyses of 2 channels in 

the Sand Hills, NE (Eq. 2) and 15 mud-rich channels in 

the Missiour River Basin (Eq. 3) [1].

Terrestrial analogs provide helpful opportunities to 

test the relationships in Table 1 among channel form, 

discharge, and sediment size. The Usuktuk River on 

the North Slope, Alaska and Quinn River in the Black 

Rock Desert, Nevada (Figure 1) [12] have been inves-

tigated as potential analogs for meandering channels in 

the Aeolis Dorsa region, Mars [5,12,13], based on their 

well-developed meanders in permafrost and low-

vegetation floodplains, respectively. These channels in 

Alaska and Nevada are sand-dominated and mud-

dominated, respectively. How well do form-discharge 

relationships predict discharge in these well-sorted and 

possible analog channels? 

Hypotheses:  Null: The influence of sediment size 

on channel width for a given discharge is irrelevant 

across all sediment sizes. If true, this hypothesis would 

validate the common use of non-specific relationships. 

Alternative: The influence of sediment size on channel 

width for a given discharge is relevant across all sedi-

ment sizes. If true, this hypothesis would require the 

use of only sediment-specific relationships. 

Methods:  Hypotheses were tested by comparing 

records and/or models of Q2yr and predictions of dis-

charge derived from width measurements coupled with 

non-specific and sediment-specific relationships. 

Although no gauge record exists for the Usuktuk 

River, it is a tributary of the Meade River. The Meade 

has a gauge record from 2006 to 2014 and has similar 

sediment and hydrological regimes as the Usuktuk 

[14]. We carried out the analysis using data from the 

Meade River. Discharges of peak streamflows for the 

Meade River at Atasuk, AK indicate the Q2yr is 702 m

 (waterdata.usgs.gov). There is no nearby gauge sta-

tion for the Quinn River, NV, but we use an in situ 

estimate of bankfull discharge, 11.9 m
3
 s

-1
 [15], as an 

approximation of the Q2yr. 

Observations of aerial photographs and digital ele-

vation models of the North Slope of Alaska (5-m res.)  

and Quinn River (1-m res.) were made using ArcMap 

software. For both rivers, samples of channel width 

were made by measuring bankfull width every 500 

meters of channel length. Bankfull width was meas-

ured as the distance between the abrupt change in 

slope, nearest to the channel, on opposite banks. Sam-

ples of channel width were coupled with a non-specific 

form-discharge relationship (Eq. 1) and the relevant 

sediment-specific relationship (either Eq. 2 or 3) to 

create distributions of predicted discharge. 

Results:  Measurements of bankfull width and es-

timates of Q2yr, from the outputs of form-discharge 

relationships, are shown in Table 2.

Discussion:  For the sand-dominated Meade River, 

the accuracy of discharge predictions increased when 

width measurements were coupled with the sediment-

specific relationship rather than the non-specific rela-

tionship. In this case, the null hypothesis can be reject-

ed and the alternative hypothesis can be accepted be-

cause the relationship between channel form and dis-

charge is influenced by the properties and abundance 

of sand. Sand is the most mobile sediment, and causes 

large variation in channel width for a given flood dis-

charge [1]. If channels on Mars are sand-dominated, 

conventional use of non-specific form-discharge rela-

tionships will overestimate Q2yr. 

For the mud-dominated Quinn River, the accuracy 

of discharge predictions decreased by coupling width 

measurements with the sediment-specific relationship 

compared to the non-specific relationship. In this case, 

the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. If channels on 

Mars are mud-dominated, use of non-specific form-

discharge relationships will also overestimate Q2yr. 

Thus, in either case, these results indicate that dis-

charge estimates on Mars made using non-specific 

relationships are overestimates.   

Future Work:  This work will be advanced by sta-

tistical analyses to determine the significance of differ-

ences between Q2yr and discharge predictions from 

non-specific and sediment-specific relationships. New 

form-discharge relationships for mud-dominated chan-

nel (as opposed to mud-rich channels) may be derived 

from analysis of channels in the Basin and Range, NV.

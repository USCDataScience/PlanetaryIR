Introduction and Rationale:  The Alpha Particle 

X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on the Mars Science La-

boratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity, is an arm-mounted 

bulk chemistry instrument that performs high-precision 

in-situ measurements of rocks and soils [1]. Compared 

to the Mars Exploration Rover APXS, the MSL APXS 

is 5x more sensitive and has a Peltier cooler that im-

proves the nominal ambient operational temperature 

from -40
o
 C to -5

o
 C [1, 2]. The increase in sensitivity 

and improved integration during warmer temperatures 

allows the APXS to characterize a larger area than its 

nominal field of view (FOV) by utilizing a raster tech-

nique. Morning or evening rasters can be used to inves-

tigate sample heterogeneity (compositional and/or tex-

tural) on the order of the APXS FOV.  

Arm-mounted instruments, including the APXS, 

have placement uncertainty (accuracy <15 mm; preci-

sion <10 mm) [3]. Arm placement adds uncertainty to 

the interpretation of APXS data given an in-contact 

APXS FOV of ~15 mm [1]. Here, we combine APXS 

data with images from the Mars Hand Lens Imager 

(MAHLI) to constrain APXS positioning on the Mar-

tian targets Sayunei, Stephen and Morrison (Fig. 1). 

Figure 1: MAHLI images of APXS raster targets 

Sayunei (top left, sol 165), Stephen (top right, sols 

627-629) and Morrison (bottom, sols 767-779).  

Method:  MAHLI images were analyzed by classi-

fying pixels into orthogonal bins based on the assump-

tion that visually distinct phases have a distinct APXS 

composition. The orthogonality correlates directly to 

elemental and/or spectral variation observed in the 

APXS data. The APXS raster FOVs are overlaid on the 

MAHLI image. The positional assumption, given iden-

tical MAHLI and APXS targets, is that the central 

APXS FOV is aligned with the center of the MAHLI 

image. The pixels within each APXS FOV are ana-

lyzed and tabulated based on their radially dependent 

contribution resulting in a relative abundance of each 

phase for each APXS FOV. The test raster is translated 

and/or rotated to assess a different orientation. The 

linear relationship between phase abundances and the 

appropriate APXS spectral variation is compared using 

a bivariate weighted least squares regression [4] to 

infer a more-likely APXS raster position and orienta-

tion. 

Sayunei is a mudstone from the Yellowknife Bay 

area (John Klein class [5]) with a cross-cutting vein. 

APXS data collected from a 2x2+1 raster showed ele-

vated CaO and SO3 in three of the five raster positions 

and was complimented by MAHLI images of the cen-

tral APXS spot only [6]. This light-toned vein material 

is visually distinct, resulted in CaO and SO3 variation 

in the APXS spectra and is interpreted to be CaSO4. As 

the amount of vein material in the APXS FOV increas-

es, the SO3 measured by the APXS will increase. This 

linear relationship between vein material (light-toned 

pixels) and SO3 (wt%) was used to infer an APXS ras-

ter position that not only agrees with proportionality 

but also with upper- and lower-limit bounds (Fig. 2). 

Stephen is a thin fracture fill/layer within 

silt/sandstone at the Kimberley waypoint. APXS data 

collected from a 2x2+1 raster showed variation in the 

APXS norm (proxy for instrument standoff) as well as 

dust-dependent signals. The APXS raster was compli-

mented by 5 cm MAHLI images on the all raster spots. 

Pixels from the MAHLI image(s) were classified as 

either dust, rock or negligible based on pixel saturation 

level and sample topography. A combination of ele-

mental and topographic linear relationships was used to 

infer a more-representative APXS raster position (Fig. 

3). 

Morrison is a brushed, raised, diagenetic feature at 

the Pahrump waypoint [7, 8]. APXS data obtained via 

a 2x2+1 raster showed elevated MgO, SO3, Ni and, to 

a lesser extent, Cl and Br in the diagenetic feature rela-

tive to the immediately adjacent bedrock [7, 8]. 

MAHLI images of the target were taken on earlier sols 

of the central APXS raster spot only. As with Stephen, 

a ternary pixel classification system was used on Mor-

rison, binning pixels orthogonally as dust, bare rock or

rosette, with various linear correlations to spectral het-

erogeneity observed in the APXS data.  

Results and Observations:  Improved positioning 

of APXS rasters through MAHLI pixel analysis result-

ed in significant shifting (4-8 mm) of the APXS raster 

center from the center of the MAHLI image consider-

ing the size and sensitivity of the APXSâ€™s FOV. APXS 

placement deviation from the center of MAHLI images 

is comparable to observed offsets of a Dust Removal 

Tool brushed center and a post-brush MAHLI image 

center (i.e. ~3 mm offset on sol 755 Maturango). The 

APXS raster edges are not parallel to MAHLI image 

edges as confirmed when MAHLI images are acquired 

on each APXS raster spot.  

APXS raster positioning for Sayunei exists within 

arm placement uncertainty such that the elevated CaO 

and SO3 observed is attributed to the vein material and 

is not elevated in the host rock (Fig. 2). Combining 

target topography and visually distinct phases im-

proved the Stephen raster location (Fig. 3, rotation was 

minimal as initial orientation was dictated by MAHLI 

images of each APXS raster location). The best-

agreement raster offsets from MAHLI image center for 

Sayunei and Stephen are in the same direction, despite 

the flipped arm orientation between the two locations, 

hinting perhaps at a systematic placement error (Fig.4). 

A preliminary analysis of the Morrison raster indicates 

strongly that the APXS raster is offset from the 

MAHLI image center as well. 

Conclusions:  APXS rasters are a powerful tool for 

quickly analyzing heterogeneous samples. MAHLI 

images with visually distinct phases can reduce APXS 

FOV uncertainty, ultimately improving interpretation 

of the target and its geological context.

MAHLI image edges and centered on 5 cm MAHLI 

image) and improved raster position (bottom) yielding 

a strong correlation between vein material in the 

APXS FOV and APXS SO3 concentration (wt%). For 

scale, the central APXS FOV diameter is ~15 mm. 

Figure 3: Raster position yielding an improved corre-

lation between radially weighted APXS FOV pixel fill 

and measured APXS norm. The updated position also 

improved the correlation between dust-related signals 

and the amount of dust in the APXS FOV.

Those rocks are primarily located in two geological units: a light-toned topographically variable, or  Rugged unit ; and overlying light-toned striated rocks forming a  Striated unit  [1]. They have been primarily analyzed by the ChemCam instrument that combines a LaserInduced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument [2, 3] and a Remote Micro-Imager (RMI) [4] at two waypoints informally named Cooperstown (sols 438 to 453) and Kimberley (sols 576 to 632). The acquisition of more than 50 ChemCam rocky targets at those two locations provides a good sampling for analyzing the spatial and stratigraphic compositional variability within the Rugged and the Striated units. Here, we report a synthesis of the chemical composition of the potassic rocks as seen by ChemCam according to their stratigraphic unit and facies at Cooperstown and Kimberley. Stratigraphy and rock facies:  Cooperstown (4.62 N, 137.42 E) is a topographic depression located between -4495 m and -4493 m in elevation. It is associated with the Rugged unit, which is topographically above the Yellowknife Bay Formation (YKB) investigated during the first phase of the mission [1]. The Cooperstown formation can be subdivided into two members: a nearly flat-laying  Pine_Plains member  corresponding to fine-grained sandstones; and an overlying  Rensselaer member  characterized by a ledge of well-cemented pebbly sandstones containing float clasts. Kimberley (-4.64 N, 137.4 E) is an area between 4484 m and -4479 m in elevation marked by the presence of three mounds (Fig. 1A). The Kimberley formation includes seven members, which are in stratigraphic order: the basal Point_Coulomb member constituted of breccio-conglomerates analyzed by ChemCam on sol 550 in the Violet Valley; the Liga member made up of planar-bedded very coarse sandstones containing granules; the Square_Top member corresponding to south-dipping faintly-laminated sandstones; the Dillinger member containing cross-stratified sandstones in which Curiosity drilled; the butte-forming massive sandstones of the Mt. Remarkable member; and fine-grained resistant boulders possibly related to the Hummocky Plains unit, or  Beagle member  (Fig. 1B) [5, 6]. The Dillinger and Mt. Remarkable members are associated with the Rugged unit and are located stratigraphically between the Hummocky Plains unit and the Striated unit. The Square_Top and Liga members are associated with the Striated unit (Fig. 1B). Chemical composition:  The sedimentary rocks of the Cooperstown and Kimberley formations have a basaltic-like composition according to Partial Least Squares (PLS), a multivariate regression method [7] (Fig. 2A). Those sedimentary rocks primarily differ in composition from the previously encountered  Fig. 1: Overview of the Kimberley formation.

(C) ICA score plot of K component versus Na component. Sheepbed and Bardin_Bluff (conglomerate, Darwin waypoint) are indicated.  sedimentary rocks in YKB or the conglomerates in Darwin [8] by their significantly higher content in K2O not coupled to higher Na2O, except for the Point_Coulomb member (Fig. 2B). The Dillinger and Mt. Remarkable members (Rugged unit at Kimberley) especially display the rocks most enriched in K (Fig. 2A). An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [9] reveals that the Na/K ratio of the Dillinger and the Mt. Remarkable members is much lower than for the other members (Fig. 2C). The K-feldspar and illite clays identified in the Dillinger member by CheMin [10] are consistent with this enrichment in K. Overall the K abundance gradually increases between the lower Striated unit (Liga and Square_Top members) and the Rugged unit (Dillinger and Mt. Remarkable members) in the Kimberley formation. The Rugged unit exposed at Kimberley shows a higher K content than at Cooperstown. Hydrogen is present in all potassic rocks analyzed by ChemCam [12], which is consistent with the presence of hydrous minerals such as clays [10]. ChemCam analyses also reveals high contents in F [13], Li, Mn [14], Zn [15] and Ni in the Kimberley formation, and in Mn in the Cooperstown formation.  Interpretation and discussion: The sedimentary rocks encountered at Cooperstown and Kimberley differ in composition from those in YKB by their enhanced K content. Assuming a fluvial origin of those sediments [5], the progressive shift to higher K from Cooperstown to Kimberley implies a contribution of a potassic source rock with increasing effect at Kimberley. The increase in K from the lower members to the upper members at Kimberley also suggests a gradual increase of this contribution with time. The origin of this source is currently unknown [16] but could be Krich intrusions or K-rich ash layers on the Gale rim. The stratigraphical relationships with the other sandstones (such as YKB) being unclear, it is not possible to determine if this K-rich source was incised during the overall deposition of fluvial sandstones or the final gasp from a divergence in the fluvial flow type/direction or watershed extent. The presence of F, Mn and Zn in Kimberley rocks also suggest that alteration processes, possibly pre- and post-depositional may have contributed to their enrichment in K. References: [1] Grotzinger et al.

Its laser pulses remove dust and to profile through weathering coatings of rocks up to 7 m away. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) produces emission spectra of materials ablated from the samples in electronically excited states. As the plasma cools, elements can recombine and molecular emission lines are observed. Recent experiments [3] have shown that some of  these molecular emissions can be much brighter than the associated atomic lines, especially when halogens and rare earth elements are present. We observed these molecular emissions in some of the ChemCam spectra and report the first dectection of chlorine and fluorine with ChemCam. It is also the first time ever that fluorine has been detected on the surface of Mars [4]. Among all the F-bearing observations, one third are observed in the Kimberley outcrop. We will discuss the potential mineralogies related to these observations as well as the related elemental correlations and propose interpretations. Kimberley geological description: Curiosity spent sols 572-632 analyzing outcrops of sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate in a region of Aeolis Palus informally named the Kimberley formation. The exposed strata contained three informal members: the lowermost  Square Top  member, an overlying  Dillinger  member, and the uppermost  Mt. Remarkable  member [5]. Following reconnaissance, the Dillinger member became the target for drilling at a site named Windjana. The drilled outcrop exposed sandstones with centimeter-scale stratification organized into bedsets 10-20 cm thick that display low angle, planar to trough crossbedding. A range of sediment transport directions, reconstructed from crossbed dip directions, suggests complex paleoflow hydraulics with a primarily southwesterly flow in an ancient fluvial (or possibly mixed fluvial-aeolian) system [6]. The Dillinger member is crosscut by  fins  that are more resistant than the surrounding rock. These features are interpreted as thin, mineral-filled fractures that were exposed by differential aeolian abrasion of the surrounding country rock. The veins cross-cut depositional stratification at shallow angles; in places the fractures run parallel to bedding planes, perhaps exploiting them as zones of weakness. We infer that this fracture network created the porosity and permeability that allowed subsurface fluids to move preferentially along these paths of higher hydraulic conductivity. Mineral precipitation occurred during fluid flow, and eventually occluded much or all of the fracture porosity. Kimberley elemental composition as seen by ChemCam: Kimberley rocks differ in composition from previous study areas in Gale such as the Sheepbed member in Yellowknife Bay [7, 8, 9]. This is confirmed by the elemental compostions obtained on the 676 observation points by the ChemCam instrument. A striking charatereistic is that the rocks at Kimberley are enriched in K, which matches the substantial fraction of K-feldspar observed by X-ray diffraction data from the CheMin instrument [15%; 10]. K2O concentrations can reach up to 10 to 12 wt.%. All Kimberley rocks also show elevated Fe and Mg. Ca and Na are relatively low. Trace elements Li, Rb, Zn, Ni are strongly enriched. As much as 7.0 wt.% ZnO in the Yarrada target (Sol 628) was detected [11]. Targets Stephen, Neil, and Mondooma were also found to contain very high MnO contents, with > 30 wt. % MnO near the surface [12]. Fluorine observation in Kimberley: 36 observations show the characteristic molecular CaF emission at 603 nm (Fig. 1.). The F content of these observations ranges from 0.2 wt.% up to 0.8 wt.%.   Figure 1: Kimberley CCam spectra showing the characteritics feature of the CaF molecular emission around 603 nm. To achieve quantification, experiments have been conducted mixing fluorite with a certified basalt powder standard, BHVO-2, under martian pressure conditions on the ChemCam-dedicated setup at LANL. 1989.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Twelve mixing ratios ranging from 0.07 wt.% to 50 wt.% CaF2 were analyzed and for each mixture five observation points were acquired. The 30 spectra at each observation point were averaged together. After careful processing of the data [13] it is possible to draw a relationship between the area of the CaF emission band centered at 603 nm and the amount of fluorine present in the sample. With these new calibration experiments, a detection limit of about 0.2 wt.% fluorine is reached [4].  It is  notable that these CaF observations are spread throughout all units of the Kimberley outcrop. Interestingly, all 9 points of the Dillinger target (Sol 628) contain fluorine at a level of about 0.5 wt.%, indicating that fluorine is present in one of the major phases and not as accessory phases..  Correlation with major elements: Among the Kimberley observations, fluorine is generally correlated with K, Al, Si and Mg in that decreasing order. These correlations suggest that the F-bearing phase may be compatible with a silicate phase. Of the phases determined by CheMin in the Windjana drill sample the likeliest hosts are clay minerals or the amorphous component. Several ChemCam points having around 0.6 wt.% F and 5 wt.% Ca display a positive Ca-F correlation, making fluorite [CaF2] a plausible phase. Fluorite was not detected by CheMin but may be present below XRD detection limits.  Figure 2: Plot of the Li content vs. the MgO content for targets having more tha 0.2 wt.% F. Correlation with minor and trace elements: In Kimberley, fluorine is mainly correlated with lithium. The average lithium content in these high fluorine targets is of the order of 50 ppm with a maximum of about 140 ppm in the point  Frome_Rock-5. The value of 50 ppm is comparable to what is observed at Bathurst_Inlet [14]  Lithium observation in Kimberley: The average lithium content is of the order of 25 ppm for the 676 observations on the Kimberley outcrop. This value is much larger than the average Li content of 5 to 10 ppm observed so far with ChemCam [14] and in the SNC meteorites [15]. For those targets that contain fluorine, lithium exhibits a very strong correlation with magnesium (Fig. 2).  Interpretation: On Earth, fluorine and lithium are widespread in micas [16]. This is of great importance in the study of clay minerals because of the degradation of the micas, by weathering, through illite to mixed-layer clays and then to smectites which are observed in the CheMin data [10]. The lithium is generally not retained by clay minerals at the site of this transformation; because it is highly mobile, it is soon weathered out of the mica and either carried away in solution or incorporated into the structure of newly formed clay minerals. Although undetected by CheMin, micas may occur in sediment source regions and they should be considered as possible lithium sources. A relation may exist between the content of lithium and the content of fluorine in smectites. In samples of smectite containing less than 1 wt.% fluorine, the lithium content increases with the fluorine content [17]. High temperature hydrothermal processes in granodioritic settings  are often  invoked to explain these mineralogical associations, with formation of clays from chloritization of micas These alteration processes are accompanied by feldspathization at temperatures above 300 C. However, illite/micas and Mg-smectites may provide from distinct alteration type, the latter suggesting more low-T alteration, so that the observed minerals may not form in a single process. Alteration of source rocks at high-T occurring first and then alteration of transported sediments by fluids during diagenesis occurring next. Finally, when the temperature decreases to ~100 C, fluorite can precipitate in place simultaneously with the zinc and manganese oxides. References: [1] Maurice S. et al.

Curiosity has drilled three rocks to date and has analyzed the mineralogy, chemical composition, and textures of the samples with the science payload. The drilled rocks are the Sheepbed mudstone at Yellowknife Bay on the plains of Gale crater (John Klein and Cumberland targets), the Dillinger sandstone at the Kimberley on the plains of Gale crater (Windjana target), and a sedimentary unit in the Pahrump Hills in the lowermost rocks at the base of Mt. Sharp (Confidence Hills target). CheMin is the Xray diffractometer on Curiosity, and its data are used to identify and determine the abundance of mineral phases. Secondary phases can tell us about aqueous alteration processes and, thus, can help to elucidate past aqueous environments. Here, we present the secondary mineralogy of the rocks drilled to date as seen by CheMin and discuss past aqueous environments in Gale crater, the potential cementing agents in each rock, and how amorphous materials may play a role in cementing the sediments. Methods: The CheMin instrument collects Co-K  X-ray diffraction patterns in a Debye-Scherrer transmission geometry, and the resulting 2D patterns are converted to 1D patterns by circumferential integration (Fig. 1). Rietveld refinement techniques produce unit cell parameters for individual minerals [1], and FULLPAT models determine abundances that include poorly crystalline and amorphous phases [2]. The composition of the amorphous component is calculated by subtracting the composition of all crystalline phases as determined through models of CheMin data from the bulk APXS composition of the drill fines [3,4]. Sheepbed Mudstone: Models of CheMin data from John Klein and Cumberland show that the major phases in the Sheepbed mudstone include plagioclase, pyroxene, trioctahedral smectite (Fe-saponite), and amorphous phases (Fig. 2a,b) [5]. Minor phases include magnetite, anhydrite, bassanite, akaganeite, sanidine, and pyrrhotite. Smectite, Ca-sulfates, and akaganeite are secondary minerals that may be cementing the Sheepbed mudstone. Furthermore, the mineral assemblage suggests that the saponite and magnetite are authigenic and formed in-situ from the alteration of olivine and amorphous material [5-7]. Calculations of the amorphous component show that the amorphous materials are enriched in FeOT, CaO, Na2O, SO3, and P2O5 and depleted in SiO2, Al2O3, and MgO relative to a basaltic glass composition [5]. These calculations are being updated based on new refinements of unit cell parameters (see Morris et al., this meeting), but the values suggest the amorphous material is secondary and may be composed of nanophase Fe-oxides (npOx), amorphous sulfates and phosphates and/or sulfate and phosphate chemisorbed to surfaces of nanophase materials [8], and minor amounts of amorphous silicates Dillinger Sandstone: The unit cell parameters for the minerals in the Windjana target are being refined at the time of this writing. Models of XRD data show that the major phases in the Dillinger sandstone include pyroxene, K-feldspar, magnetite, phyllosilicate (illite and/or smectite), and amorphous phases (Fig. 2c). The minor phases include plagioclase, akaganeite, anhydrite, pyrrhotite, ilmenite, and hematite (see Treiman et al., this meeting, for a complete discussion). Phyllosilicate, anhydrite, akaganeite, and magnetite are potential secondary minerals that may help cement the Dillinger sandstone. The origin of these phases (i.e., authigenic or detrital) is unknown. Preliminary calculations of the amorphous component in Windjana show that it is enriched in FeOT, MgO, and SO3, and depleted in SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, and Na2O relative to a basaltic glass composition. This composition suggests that the amorphous component is made up of secondary phases, possibly including npOx, amorphous sulfates, and minor amounts of amorphous silicates. Pahrump Hills: Unit cell parameters for the minerals in the Confidence Hills target are also being refined at the time of this writing. Models show that the major phases are plagioclase, pyroxene, hematite, phyllosilicate (smectite and/or illite), and amorphous materials (Fig. 2d). Minor phases include magnetite, forster2038.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)ite, K-feldspar, and jarosite (see Cavanagh et al., this meeting, for a complete discussion). Phyllosilicate, hematite, and jarosite are potential secondary minerals that may help cement these sediments. The origin of these phases is currently unknown. Preliminary calculations of the composition of the amorphous component show that it is enriched in SiO2 and SO3, suggesting that it is secondary, may have formed in a leaching environment, and may help cement these sediments. Discussion: There are a variety of secondary phases that may cement the rocks at Gale crater, and if these phases are authigenic, they imply that the sediments experienced different aqueous conditions and multiple fluid episodes. The presence of Ca-sulfates and saponite in John Klein and Cumberland suggests an aqueous environment with low ionic strength and near neutral pH [5]; however, the presence of akaganeite suggests acidic fluids also affected the sediments. The abundance of K-spar and the potential presence of illite in Windjana must be considered when interpreting the formation of the Dillinger sandstone because these phases can form in diagenetic K-rich environments on Earth [e.g., 9]. The presence of Fe-sulfates in Confidence Hills rather than Ca-sulfates indicates an episode of acidic aqueous fluids in the sediments at the base of Mt. Sharp, and the hematite and jarosite could have formed in-situ from oxidized Fe-rich fluids. Calculations of the amorphous component in each rock suggest amorphous phases are secondary and the composition varies between samples. References: [1] Rietveld H. M. (1969) J. Appl. Cryst., 2.

Windjana is remarkable in containing an abundance of potassium feldspar (and thus K in its bulk chemistry) combined with a low abundance of plagioclase (and low Na/K in its chemistry). The source of this enrichment in K is not clear, but has significant implications for the geology of Gale Crater and of Mars. The high K could be intrinsic to the sediment and imply that the sediment source area (Gale Crater rim) includes K-rich basalts and possibly more evolved rocks derived from alkaline magmas. Alternatively, the high K could be diagenetic and imply that the Gale Crater sediments were altered by K-rich aqueous fluids after deposition.  Kimberley and Windjana:  The Kimberley area (~4.6 S,137.4 E) was targeted for investigation from orbital (HiRISE) imagery because at least three distinct sedimentary units are exposed in contact there [1]. Uppermost is a massive sandstone, which may include the resistant capping unit encountered frequently on Curiosity s traverse. Next is a thinly bedded, cross-bedded sandstone   the  Dillinger Unit.  The lowest exposures are of the  striated unit  documented from orbit; it consists of thinly bedded siltstone, sandstone, and minor conglomerate dipping generally to the south. The MSL team selected a target in the Dillinger Unit, named Windjana, for mineralogical analysis.   CheMin X-ray Diffraction:  The Windjana rock was drilled on sol 621, following a successful minidrill test of rock properties and stability. The drill sample was sieved to <150  m, and an aliquot was delivered to CheMin on sol 622 into an unused Mylar cell. It was analyzed [2-4] for 23 hours total over sols 623 632 (Fig. 1). A second aliquot was delivered on sol 640 to a Mylar cell that had been used previously and dumped; it was analyzed for 22 hours over sols 640 656.  2-D diffraction images were corrected for geometry and hot pixels on the spacecraft, further despeckled manually on the ground, and converted to 1-D diffraction patterns [5]; results for the pristine cell are discussed here (Fig. 1). Diffraction peaks were identified, and proportions of crystalline phases were determined by Rietveld refinement, using commercial codes Jade  and Topas ; Table 1 is a new refinement. Detection limits for crystalline phases are at best ~0.5% wt. [2], depending on their absolute peak intensities and  2  positions relative to those of more abundant phases. The proportions of amorphous components were calculated with the program FULLPAT [6]. Both aliquots of the Windjana drill powder contained the same minerals in similar proportions.  Mineralogy: The minerals in the Windjana sandstone are typical of basalt, with limited aqueous alteration (Table 1); its mineral proportions are notable for its high abundances of K feldspar and of iron oxides (Table 1). These mineral proportions are reflected in Table 1.

As in other rock samples analyzed by CheMin, Windjana contains significant proportions of phyllosilicates and amorphous material.  The olivine is Fe-forsterite (Fo50-70) and the plagioclase is andesine (~An40). The alkali feldspar is K-rich and partially disordered, based on its b and c unit-cell parameters. A sanidine structurre model gave the best fits; diagenetic K-spar can be similarly ordered. The compositions of augite and pigeonite are not yet constrained. Orthopyroxene (Opx) is present at CheMin s nominal detection limit, but including it improves the model fit to the diffraction pattern.  Many mineral phases suggest low-T alteration or diagenesis. The presence of phyllosilicates is indicated by a sharp diffraction near 1.0 nm (the 001 peak) and a broad shoulder on that peak to lower  2  (Fig. 1). These diffraction features are consistent with (but not definitive for) ferromagnesian smectites with and without collapsed interlayers (analogous to those in the John_Klein and Cumberland samples); other 2:1 phyllosilicates cannot be excluded. The Windjana sample contains abundant magnetite, and minor hematite, akaganeite [ -Fe3+O(OH,Cl)], and anhydrite.  Genesis: The high abundances of K-feldspar and iron oxides in Windjana, also reflected in the APXS chemical analysis as high K and Fe (Table 2) [7], are unusual. The phyllosilicates and iron oxides could represent diagenetic deposits or cements [4,8] as invoked for other rocks in Gale crater. Several rocks analyzed by MSL APXS and ChemCam have high abundances of K2O [9-11], but Windjana is the most extreme. Two explanations of the K abundance have been offered.  Potassic Basaltic Source? The high abundances of K-feldspar and K2O in Windjana could represent the primary, detrital components of the sandstone, and thus its source rocks on the crater wall and rim. If the Windjana sediment represents a single source, it would have been ultrabasic (high FeO+MgO), low in Al & Ca, and ultrapotassic (K2O > 3%, K2O/Na2O > 2 [12]). Such basaltic rocks, ultrapotassic low-Al komatiites, are not known on Earth [13], and would require addition of K to the source region via mantle metasomatism [14]. On Earth, basaltic rocks with abundant K-feldspar rarely contain pigeonite and/or orthopyroxene (but see [15]), which suggests that the Windjana sediments were derived from multiple source lithologies.  Potassic Metasomatism/Diagenesis? The high abundances of K-feldspar and K2O in Windjana could have arisen by metasomatism or diagenesis, and so represent aqueous-phase alteration of either the sediment s protolith or the sediment in place. On Earth, potassic diagenesis is relatively common in clastic and volcanicalastic sediments [16-18], yielding K-feldspar filling voids, and as overgrowths on, or euhedral replacements, of primary detrital plagioclase. On Earth, an authigenic origin is easily demonstrated by microtexural relationships observed in petrographic thin sections   information we presently lack for Mars. Diagenesis like this is consistent with Windjana s geologic setting in a closed sedimentary basin, its relatively high Zn abundance (Table 2; inferred to reflect mobility via fluids [19]), and the inference that the magnetite could be diagenetic or cement [4]. However, such extensive aqueous alteration seems inconsistent with the persistence of olivine and abundant amorphous material.  Conclusions: Several hypotheses could explain the abundance of potassium feldspar observed by CheMin X-ray diffraction of the Windjana drill sample: 1) Detrital K-spar transported from transported from potassium-enriched basaltic source rocks by river systems that fed the crater-fringing alluvial complex; and 2) authigenesis of K-feldspar during the post-burial (diagenetic) alteration of basaltic sandstones, perhaps by the introduction of potassium-rich fluids at elevated burial temperatures. Distinguishing among these ideas will involve coordinated interpretation of data from all of Curiosity s instruments. We are grateful to all the MSL engineers and scientists. References: [1] Williams R.M.E. et al.

Very high-potential oxidants are required to oxidize Mn to insoluble, high-valence oxides that concentrate Mn in rocks and sediments; these redox potentials are much higher than those needed to oxidize Fe or S. Consequently, Mn-rich rocks on Earth closely track the rise of atmospheric oxygen [1-4]. Given the association between Mn-rich rocks and the redox state of surface environments, observations of anomalous Mn enrichments on Mars raise similar questions about redox history, solubility and aqueous transport, and availability as a metabolic substrate. Our observations suggest that at least some of the high Mn present in Gale crater occurs in the form of Mn-oxides filling veins that crosscut sandstones, requiring postdepositional precipitation as Mn(II)-bearing fluids became oxidized as they moved through the fractured strata after their deposition and lithification, allowing Mn-oxides to precipitate.  High manganese observations:  Three rock targets in the Dillinger member of the Kimberley waypoint were found to have Mn concentrations highly elevated above those of average martian crust and other rocks of the same member: Stephen (sols 611, 619, 630), Neil (sol 619), and Mondooma (sol 625) (Fig. 1) [5]. All of these targets sample resistant fracture fills that crosscut this member. ChemCam manganese abundances at Stephen, Neil, and Mondooma show average MnO abundances of 5.2 wt% (Stephen), 5.3 wt% (Neil), and 6.7 wt% (Mondooma). Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) measurements on Stephen show an average MnO abundance of 3.7 wt%, the highest Mn abundance observed by this instrument in Gale crater to date. The average Mn values from both instruments are well above typical martian igneous values of ~0.4 wt% MnO [6].  Trends with depth:  Mn abundance in ChemCam sampling locations was greatest in the first post-dust shots of the series and systematically decreased with succeeding shots (i.e. depth) (Fig. 2), with a maximum of ~35 wt% MnO on Mondooma location 1, shot 4. Fig. 1. Targets at Kimberley containing elevated Mn. (A) Overview of the Windjana drill site showing targets Stephen and Neil (MCAM 0626ML0026760010302385E01). (B) Closeup of Stephen showing a dark material beneath the surface dust layer;  this target was analyzed by both ChemCam and APXS. Note that the ChemCam analysis locations are visible as small, rounded pits in the rock surface (MAHLI 0627MH0004070000203592R00). (C) The Mondooma target is a fin-like, more resistant feature that stands out from the surrounding outcrop; the highest single-shot Mn detection at Kimberley was found in this target (~35 wt% MnO) (MCAM 0626MR0026790000401609E01).        2893.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)These results are consistent with a thin layer containing elevated Mn that was deposited adjacent to the Windjana outcrop material.  Geochemical trends: In ChemCam data, Si and Ca are inversely correlated with Mn, suggesting that the high Mn phase is not a silicate and does not contain abundant Ca. ChemCam did not detect Cl or S in the three high Mn targets; this along with the absence of C above atmospheric levels demonstrates that Mn is not present as a sulfate, chloride, or carbonate phase. The APXS composition of Stephen is generally similar to the Windjana bedrock except for elevated abundances in Mn, Mg, Cl, Ni, Cu, Co, and Zn; however, of the elements showing enrichment, only Ni and Cu show a strong correlation with Mn. These trends imply the presence of Mn-oxides, which are well known to scavenge trace metals from water [7,8]. Passive reflectance spectra of Stephen show it has very dark surface, similar to laboratory measurements of Mn-oxides [5, 9]. Implications for the martian environment: The presence of likely Mn-oxides has important implications for the past redox conditions of Gale groundwater and the martian atmosphere. Very high potential redox reactions are needed to oxidize Mn2+ at circumneutral pH (>>500 mV), which requires either O2 or species derived from O2 (e.g. reactive oxygen species). The subsurface geological setting of the fractures rules out photooxidation as a mechanism for oxidation. Oxychlorine species have been detected by the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument in solid samples throughout the rover s traverse [10-12], some of which can have high enough redox potentials to oxidize Mn(II) [13]. However, none of these oxychlorine detections were associated with Mn enrichments, despite thorough analysis by the CheMin, APXS, and ChemCam instruments [14-17]. Accordingly, we hypothesize that Mn(II)-bearing fluids encountering O2 (or species derived thereby) provides the most reasonable pathway to Mn oxidation and enrichment.  On Earth, O2 is present in groundwaters due to interaction and equilibrium with the atmosphere. Due to the extremely slow kinetics of Mn oxidation, either concentrations of martian atmospheric O2 were much higher in the past than observed today or the timescale for water flowing through these fractures were remarkably long (Fig. 3). Oxidation in a long timescale, low O2 aqueous environment is a less favorable model because chemical weathering in this environment is expected to remove O2 from fluids, making them more reducing rather than more oxidizing over time. Our results suggest that the fluids moving along Kimberley fractures were in at least partial contact with the atmosphere and that the atmosphere contained sufficient amounts of O2 to oxidize Mn. Additionally, the discovery of Mn-oxides at the rim of Endeavor crater [18] suggests that the conditions required to concentrate and deposit Mn were present well beyond Gale crater.  References: [1] Johnson, J.E. et al.

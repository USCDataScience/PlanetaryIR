Lena1 and Barry Fitz-Gerald2- Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it ; 2 79 South Court Ave, Dorchester, Dorset, DT12DA United Kingdom barryfitz_gerald@hotmail.com       Introduction: To the north-east of the crater Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

V.A. Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1. Telescopic image acquired on July 9, 2014, at 03:34 UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian (M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image.       Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0\u00b0, 0.64\u00b0 and 0.54\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

GLD100 dataset: Scholten et al. present a nearly global lunar DEM with a grid size of 100 m, the so-called GLD100 [4]. This DEM has been constructed based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.      According to the classification scheme for lunar domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to class E2.

Cross-sectional profile in east-west direction derived from the telescopic image for the domes W1(top), W2 (mid-dle) and W3 (bottom). The vertical axis is 10 times exagger-ated.      Rheologic properties: The rheologic model devel-oped in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the 1001.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 104 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~103 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m-3. The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we esti-mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-3-10-4 m s-1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

C. Floss1 and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous alteration [1\u20133], and have been found in abundance only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but contains unique features that distinguish it from typical CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is that it appears to have undergone a unique style of highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).   Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix from MIL 07687. In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the secondary alteration it has experienced. Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 33,900 \u00b5m2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively unaltered Fe-poor matrix. Following isotopic identification of the grains, we used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major element compositions of the grains, following standard procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 110 \u00b1 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 \u00b1 19 ppm for SiC, in good agreement with the abundances determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges and medians observed for presolar silicates from primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 [e.g., 1 and references therein]. Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or akagan\u00e9ite [7, 8].  Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from MIL 07687. The results of our imaging survey indicate that presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. However, we do see some differences in the presolar grain abundances between the two types of matrix. Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered ones. However, the difference is not as large as might be expected given that presolar silicates are more susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar grain types. In addition to the difference in abundance, we observe compositional differences in the presolar silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which have a factor of two higher median Fe content than presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.  Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains per 1000 \u00b5m2) in MIL 07687. Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2. This difference is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration. References: [1] Floss and Stadermann (2012) MAPS 47, 992.

In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1. Telescopic image acquired on July 9, 2014, at 03:34 UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian (M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image.       Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0\u00b0, 0.64\u00b0 and 0.54\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

This DEM has been constructed based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.      According to the classification scheme for lunar domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to class E2.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model devel-oped in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the 1001.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 104 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~103 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m-3. The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we esti-mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-3-10-4 m s-1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

Lena1 and Barry Fitz-Gerald2- Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it ; 2 79 South Court Ave, Dorchester, Dorset, DT12DA United Kingdom barryfitz_gerald@hotmail.com       Introduction: To the north-east of the crater Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

V.A. Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

C. Floss1 and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous alteration [1\u20133], and have been found in abundance only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but contains unique features that distinguish it from typical CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is that it appears to have undergone a unique style of highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).   Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix from MIL 07687. In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the secondary alteration it has experienced. Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 33,900 \u00b5m2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively unaltered Fe-poor matrix. Following isotopic identification of the grains, we used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major element compositions of the grains, following standard procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 110 \u00b1 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 \u00b1 19 ppm for SiC, in good agreement with the abundances determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges and medians observed for presolar silicates from primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 [e.g., 1 and references therein]. Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or akagan\u00e9ite [7, 8].  Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from MIL 07687. The results of our imaging survey indicate that presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. However, we do see some differences in the presolar grain abundances between the two types of matrix. Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered ones. However, the difference is not as large as might be expected given that presolar silicates are more susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar grain types. In addition to the difference in abundance, we observe compositional differences in the presolar silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which have a factor of two higher median Fe content than presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.  Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains per 1000 \u00b5m2) in MIL 07687. Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2. This difference is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration. References: [1] Floss and Stadermann (2012) MAPS 47, 992.

C. Floss. Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: In addition to the first unambiguous cometary samples, from comet 81P/Wild 2 [1], NASA\u2019s Stardust mission was designed to collect the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust. The Stardust interstellar dust collector collected particles for 229 days during two exposures prior to the spacecraft encounter with Wild 2 and tracked the interstellar dust stream for all but 34 days of that time. The Al foils make up ~15% of the total collection surface and about 12-15 particles, with 2/3 of those less than ~1 \u00b5m in size, were expected to have impacted the available Al foil area. The initial investigation of these samples took place under the auspices of the CAPTEM-approved Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE). The ISPE proposed to carry out non-destructive, non-invasive searches for, and analyses of, interstellar dust candidates in the Stardust interstellar tray and focused on two parallel investigations: extraction and analysis of tracks in aerogel identified through Stardust@home, and search for and characterization of impact craters in the aluminum foils [2].  The work of the ISPE team resulted in the discovery and characterization of seven probable  interstellar dust particles [3], four of which were identified from impact craters in the Al foil [4]. At the formal conclusion of the ISPE two years ago, only ~5% of the available Al foil area had been measured. We have continued the work of scanning Al foils from the Stardust interstellar tray in order to identify additional interstellar dust candidates. Here we report the results of our work to date. Experimental: Foil scanning is done in automated mode using the JEOL 840a SEM at Washington University. By combining our instrument control software with custom written software, we are able to automatically map an entire foil in a single (long) run. Foils are divided into multiple grids of about 0.25 mm2. Manual z-axis focusing is done in the center of each region, after which the grids are further divided into individual images 106 x 80 \u00b5m in size. The z-axis positions are interpolated from one grid center to the next to ensure good focus for all individual images in a grid and the x, y, and z coordinates are individually stored. The images are mapped at 15 kV, 5 nA for 10 sec per frame, providing a resolution of ~50 nm/pixel with a dwell time of 0.001 sec/\u00b5m2. The entire array is imaged automatically in sequence, and each image is saved with a unique label identifying its position on the foil.  Images from the foils (~5000 for short foils and ~10,000 for long foils) are manually examined independently by at least two undergraduate students, and the candidate craters identified are subsequently ranked. The most likely candidates are then imaged at higher resolution to ascertain which are actual impact craters. Results: We have scanned a total of four long (N) foils and two short (W) foils: 1010N, 1031N, 1032W, 1047N, 1061N and 1063W. Image examination is still in progress on foil 1010N, but we have identified a feature on this foil that appears to be an unusually large impact crater (Fig. 1). However, additional analysis (e.g., Auger spectroscopy and/or FIB/TEM) will be needed to confirm the identification. A similar feature found on foil 1047N during the ISPE ultimately turned out to be a hole created during the foil flattening process [4].  Figure 1. Secondary electron image 314@43 from interstellar foil 1010N,1. The impact feature is approximately 4 \u00b5m in diameter. Approximately 2700 candidate craters were identified from the other foils, of which 1125 were selected for higher resolution imaging. Table 1 shows the resulting 19 likely impact craters. Eleven of these were investigated as part of the ISPE [4]; the remaining eight are shown in Fig. 2. While some are clear impact craters, others are more ambiguous and, like 314@43 mentioned above, will require additional analysis for confirmation. Outlook:  The number of impact craters identified on individual foils is clearly highly variable and the foils examined by our laboratory as part of the ISPE fortuitously contained a relatively high proportion of craters. Moreover, many of the potential new impact 1005.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)features shown in Fig. 2 are unconventional compared to \u2018traditional craters\u2019 and it remains to be seen whether compositional analyses can confirm an extraterrestrial or even secondary impact origin for these features. Despite these obstacles, the results of the ISPE demonstrate that continued scanning and examination of the Al foils on the interstellar collector has the potential to provide important new information about contemporary interstellar dust.

In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1. Telescopic image acquired on July 9, 2014, at 03:34 UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian (M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image.       Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0\u00b0, 0.64\u00b0 and 0.54\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.      According to the classification scheme for lunar domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 belong to class C1.

Cross-sectional profile in east-west direction derived from the telescopic image for the domes W1(top), W2 (mid-dle) and W3 (bottom). The vertical axis is 10 times exagger-ated.      Rheologic properties: The rheologic model devel-oped in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the 1001.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 104 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~103 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m-3. The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we esti-mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-3-10-4 m s-1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

This was mapped as be-ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

V.A. Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

C. Floss1 and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous alteration [1\u20133], and have been found in abundance only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but contains unique features that distinguish it from typical CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is that it appears to have undergone a unique style of highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).   Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix from MIL 07687. In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the secondary alteration it has experienced. Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 33,900 \u00b5m2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively unaltered Fe-poor matrix. Following isotopic identification of the grains, we used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major element compositions of the grains, following standard procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 110 \u00b1 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 \u00b1 19 ppm for SiC, in good agreement with the abundances determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges and medians observed for presolar silicates from primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 [e.g., 1 and references therein]. Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or akagan\u00e9ite [7, 8].  Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from MIL 07687. The results of our imaging survey indicate that presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. However, we do see some differences in the presolar grain abundances between the two types of matrix. Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered ones. However, the difference is not as large as might be expected given that presolar silicates are more susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar grain types. In addition to the difference in abundance, we observe compositional differences in the presolar silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which have a factor of two higher median Fe content than presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.  Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains per 1000 \u00b5m2) in MIL 07687. Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2. This difference is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration. References: [1] Floss and Stadermann (2012) MAPS 47, 992.

C. Floss. Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: In addition to the first unambiguous cometary samples, from comet 81P/Wild 2 [1], NASA\u2019s Stardust mission was designed to collect the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust. The Stardust interstellar dust collector collected particles for 229 days during two exposures prior to the spacecraft encounter with Wild 2 and tracked the interstellar dust stream for all but 34 days of that time. The Al foils make up ~15% of the total collection surface and about 12-15 particles, with 2/3 of those less than ~1 \u00b5m in size, were expected to have impacted the available Al foil area. The initial investigation of these samples took place under the auspices of the CAPTEM-approved Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE). The ISPE proposed to carry out non-destructive, non-invasive searches for, and analyses of, interstellar dust candidates in the Stardust interstellar tray and focused on two parallel investigations: extraction and analysis of tracks in aerogel identified through Stardust@home, and search for and characterization of impact craters in the aluminum foils [2].  The work of the ISPE team resulted in the discovery and characterization of seven probable  interstellar dust particles [3], four of which were identified from impact craters in the Al foil [4]. At the formal conclusion of the ISPE two years ago, only ~5% of the available Al foil area had been measured. We have continued the work of scanning Al foils from the Stardust interstellar tray in order to identify additional interstellar dust candidates. Here we report the results of our work to date. Experimental: Foil scanning is done in automated mode using the JEOL 840a SEM at Washington University. By combining our instrument control software with custom written software, we are able to automatically map an entire foil in a single (long) run. Foils are divided into multiple grids of about 0.25 mm2. Manual z-axis focusing is done in the center of each region, after which the grids are further divided into individual images 106 x 80 \u00b5m in size. The z-axis positions are interpolated from one grid center to the next to ensure good focus for all individual images in a grid and the x, y, and z coordinates are individually stored. The images are mapped at 15 kV, 5 nA for 10 sec per frame, providing a resolution of ~50 nm/pixel with a dwell time of 0.001 sec/\u00b5m2. The entire array is imaged automatically in sequence, and each image is saved with a unique label identifying its position on the foil.  Images from the foils (~5000 for short foils and ~10,000 for long foils) are manually examined independently by at least two undergraduate students, and the candidate craters identified are subsequently ranked. The most likely candidates are then imaged at higher resolution to ascertain which are actual impact craters. Results: We have scanned a total of four long (N) foils and two short (W) foils: 1010N, 1031N, 1032W, 1047N, 1061N and 1063W. Image examination is still in progress on foil 1010N, but we have identified a feature on this foil that appears to be an unusually large impact crater (Fig. 1). However, additional analysis (e.g., Auger spectroscopy and/or FIB/TEM) will be needed to confirm the identification. A similar feature found on foil 1047N during the ISPE ultimately turned out to be a hole created during the foil flattening process [4].  Figure 1. Secondary electron image 314@43 from interstellar foil 1010N,1. The impact feature is approximately 4 \u00b5m in diameter. Approximately 2700 candidate craters were identified from the other foils, of which 1125 were selected for higher resolution imaging. Table 1 shows the resulting 19 likely impact craters. Eleven of these were investigated as part of the ISPE [4]; the remaining eight are shown in Fig. 2. While some are clear impact craters, others are more ambiguous and, like 314@43 mentioned above, will require additional analysis for confirmation. Outlook:  The number of impact craters identified on individual foils is clearly highly variable and the foils examined by our laboratory as part of the ISPE fortuitously contained a relatively high proportion of craters. Moreover, many of the potential new impact 1005.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)features shown in Fig. 2 are unconventional compared to \u2018traditional craters\u2019 and it remains to be seen whether compositional analyses can confirm an extraterrestrial or even secondary impact origin for these features. Despite these obstacles, the results of the ISPE demonstrate that continued scanning and examination of the Al foils on the interstellar collector has the potential to provide important new information about contemporary interstellar dust.

John D. Arfstrom, jarfstrom@gmail.com, www.JohnArfstrom.com, 904.200.2619. Introduction: Terrestrial anastomosing glacial troughs and streamlined landforms matching the ideal-ly formed channel systems of Mars are lacking. The disparate geology and topography of Earth and Mars may well have variably influenced the erosion of such landforms, which are probably more ideally formed on Mars due to the spatial uniformity and erodibility of the wide expanses of crater scarred, pristine regolith plains. Likewise, the circular ramparts that craters present against the onslaught of erosion, compared to the random forms typical on Earth, would be reflected in the geometries of eroded forms. An important ques-tion to be addressed is: how would ice sheet-generated landscapes on Earth appear if not influenced by pre-existing channeling, topography, and structure of bedrock? Considering the morphology of Kasei Valles, might regolith have supported the generation of its ideally-shaped streamlined landforms akin to the well-formed islands of glacial spillways, yet through the processes of large-scale glacial erosion evidenced by its extant areal scour indicative of wet-based erosion? Discussion: There are examples of terrestrial ice sheet-generated landforms for which landscape consid-erations might explain the above mentioned disparity.  Fig. 1a shows Kasei Valles, an erosional landform net-work comprised of interconnected or anastomosing channels or troughs, supposedly breached and non-breached streamlined landforms, and valley-wide areal scour. Thought to be a flood or glacial spillway chan-nel system, Kasei Valles is here interpreted as a set of glacial troughs and streamlined landforms, likely erod-ed by sub-polar ice sheets [1]. A terrestrial analog can be seen in Fig. 1b. It shows a portion of eastern Ellesmere Island recently exposed by the retreating ice sheet where several streamlined landforms are visible among a network of interconnected glacial troughs. Though the landforms at Kasei Valles are more curvi-linear, whereas more angular at Ellesmere, this could be explained by the uniform and easily eroded regolith, compared to the structured and resistant bedrock. Also, the widespread areal scour at Kasei Valles (Fig. 2), which extends over most streamlined forms, is more consistent with the uniform areal scour typical of ice sheets than the more spatially variable and local-ized erosion typical of the generally more focused ero-sion caused by floods. This is because the pressure melting point within ice sheets (see explanation below) promotes sheet-like erosion, except where geologic and topographic factors promote channelization.  The erosion of the exposed landscape at Ellesmere Island occurred at the base of the nearby ice sheet be-fore it retreated. Although related to intermediate-scale asymmetric and symmetric erosional landforms such as roches mountennees, whalebacks, rock drumlins, and crag and tails, the scale of the landforms are more consistent with \u201clarge-scale selective linear erosion\u201d associated with sub-polar ice sheets, which are cold-based where thinner and warm-based where thick enough [1]. Ice streams within the ice sheet slid across the bedrock with varying velocities, both spatially and temporally, to erode the anastomosing network of troughs. Although inundated by the ice sheet, the streamlined landforms were marked by relatively less basal sliding and erosion than the troughs, having been overlain by thinner, slower moving or stagnant cold-based ice. Similarly, \u201cnon-breached\u201d streamlined land-forms at Kasei Valles may have been inundated by cold-based ice, but were spared the erosion evidenced by the areal scour of adjacent lower topography. The causes of these spatial variations of erosion are better understood if one imagines the pressure melting point, where sliding may occur, as a dynamic, 3-di-mensional layer at depth, controlled by ice thickness   and basal and flow variations [1, 2]. Erosion principal-ly occurs beneath thicker ice where the pressure melt-ing point is met, where warmed by geothermal heat flux, frictional heating, and through heat transfer by water. As erosion continues, enhanced by positive feedback through increasing frictional heating and ice thickness, subglacial troughs lengthen, widen, deepen, and even connect, influenced by parameters such as topography, pre-existing channelling, and faults. Also, as ice flows from a given area, the ice thins and the pressure melting point may drop below the ground surface, causing sliding to cease and flow velocities to decrease in that area. These positive and negative feedback mechanisms cause an ice sheet to maintain a sheet like flow, yet erode troughs where velocities are highest. Anastomosing of troughs result from long-term fluctuations in ice drainage patterns within an ice sheet, represented by linked-flow networks or evolving or switching time-transgressive flow patterns.  In line with these considerations and other morpho-logical interpretations, including those previously pre-sented elsewhere [3, 4, 5], I argue for a sub-polar ice sheet-based interpretation of Kasei Valles, in which variable and widespread erosion induced areal scour and stripped regolith to leave behind its streamlined 1006.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)landform and trough system. This possible glacial ori-gin of Kasei Valles is related globally to other valley systems on Mars in an previous abstract and an associ-ated poster paper, which outlines ongoing research [6].

In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1. Telescopic image acquired on July 9, 2014, at 03:34 UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian (M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image.       Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0\u00b0, 0.64\u00b0 and 0.54\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

This DEM has been constructed based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.      According to the classification scheme for lunar domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to class E2.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model devel-oped in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the 1001.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 104 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~103 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m-3. The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we esti-mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-3-10-4 m s-1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

Lena1 and Barry Fitz-Gerald2- Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it ; 2 79 South Court Ave, Dorchester, Dorset, DT12DA United Kingdom barryfitz_gerald@hotmail.com       Introduction: To the north-east of the crater Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

V.A. Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

C. Floss1 and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous alteration [1\u20133], and have been found in abundance only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but contains unique features that distinguish it from typical CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is that it appears to have undergone a unique style of highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).   Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix from MIL 07687. In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the secondary alteration it has experienced. Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 33,900 \u00b5m2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively unaltered Fe-poor matrix. Following isotopic identification of the grains, we used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major element compositions of the grains, following standard procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 110 \u00b1 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 \u00b1 19 ppm for SiC, in good agreement with the abundances determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges and medians observed for presolar silicates from primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 [e.g., 1 and references therein]. Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or akagan\u00e9ite [7, 8].  Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from MIL 07687. The results of our imaging survey indicate that presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. However, we do see some differences in the presolar grain abundances between the two types of matrix. Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered ones. However, the difference is not as large as might be expected given that presolar silicates are more susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar grain types. In addition to the difference in abundance, we observe compositional differences in the presolar silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which have a factor of two higher median Fe content than presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.  Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains per 1000 \u00b5m2) in MIL 07687. Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2. This difference is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration. References: [1] Floss and Stadermann (2012) MAPS 47, 992.

C. Floss. Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: In addition to the first unambiguous cometary samples, from comet 81P/Wild 2 [1], NASA\u2019s Stardust mission was designed to collect the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust. The Stardust interstellar dust collector collected particles for 229 days during two exposures prior to the spacecraft encounter with Wild 2 and tracked the interstellar dust stream for all but 34 days of that time. The Al foils make up ~15% of the total collection surface and about 12-15 particles, with 2/3 of those less than ~1 \u00b5m in size, were expected to have impacted the available Al foil area. The initial investigation of these samples took place under the auspices of the CAPTEM-approved Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE). The ISPE proposed to carry out non-destructive, non-invasive searches for, and analyses of, interstellar dust candidates in the Stardust interstellar tray and focused on two parallel investigations: extraction and analysis of tracks in aerogel identified through Stardust@home, and search for and characterization of impact craters in the aluminum foils [2].  The work of the ISPE team resulted in the discovery and characterization of seven probable  interstellar dust particles [3], four of which were identified from impact craters in the Al foil [4]. At the formal conclusion of the ISPE two years ago, only ~5% of the available Al foil area had been measured. We have continued the work of scanning Al foils from the Stardust interstellar tray in order to identify additional interstellar dust candidates. Here we report the results of our work to date. Experimental: Foil scanning is done in automated mode using the JEOL 840a SEM at Washington University. By combining our instrument control software with custom written software, we are able to automatically map an entire foil in a single (long) run. Foils are divided into multiple grids of about 0.25 mm2. Manual z-axis focusing is done in the center of each region, after which the grids are further divided into individual images 106 x 80 \u00b5m in size. The z-axis positions are interpolated from one grid center to the next to ensure good focus for all individual images in a grid and the x, y, and z coordinates are individually stored. The images are mapped at 15 kV, 5 nA for 10 sec per frame, providing a resolution of ~50 nm/pixel with a dwell time of 0.001 sec/\u00b5m2. The entire array is imaged automatically in sequence, and each image is saved with a unique label identifying its position on the foil.  Images from the foils (~5000 for short foils and ~10,000 for long foils) are manually examined independently by at least two undergraduate students, and the candidate craters identified are subsequently ranked. The most likely candidates are then imaged at higher resolution to ascertain which are actual impact craters. Results: We have scanned a total of four long (N) foils and two short (W) foils: 1010N, 1031N, 1032W, 1047N, 1061N and 1063W. Image examination is still in progress on foil 1010N, but we have identified a feature on this foil that appears to be an unusually large impact crater (Fig. 1). However, additional analysis (e.g., Auger spectroscopy and/or FIB/TEM) will be needed to confirm the identification. A similar feature found on foil 1047N during the ISPE ultimately turned out to be a hole created during the foil flattening process [4].  Figure 1. Secondary electron image 314@43 from interstellar foil 1010N,1. The impact feature is approximately 4 \u00b5m in diameter. Approximately 2700 candidate craters were identified from the other foils, of which 1125 were selected for higher resolution imaging. Table 1 shows the resulting 19 likely impact craters. Eleven of these were investigated as part of the ISPE [4]; the remaining eight are shown in Fig. 2. While some are clear impact craters, others are more ambiguous and, like 314@43 mentioned above, will require additional analysis for confirmation. Outlook:  The number of impact craters identified on individual foils is clearly highly variable and the foils examined by our laboratory as part of the ISPE fortuitously contained a relatively high proportion of craters. Moreover, many of the potential new impact 1005.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)features shown in Fig. 2 are unconventional compared to \u2018traditional craters\u2019 and it remains to be seen whether compositional analyses can confirm an extraterrestrial or even secondary impact origin for these features. Despite these obstacles, the results of the ISPE demonstrate that continued scanning and examination of the Al foils on the interstellar collector has the potential to provide important new information about contemporary interstellar dust.

John D. Arfstrom, jarfstrom@gmail.com, www.JohnArfstrom.com, 904.200.2619. Introduction: Terrestrial anastomosing glacial troughs and streamlined landforms matching the ideal-ly formed channel systems of Mars are lacking. The disparate geology and topography of Earth and Mars may well have variably influenced the erosion of such landforms, which are probably more ideally formed on Mars due to the spatial uniformity and erodibility of the wide expanses of crater scarred, pristine regolith plains. Likewise, the circular ramparts that craters present against the onslaught of erosion, compared to the random forms typical on Earth, would be reflected in the geometries of eroded forms. An important ques-tion to be addressed is: how would ice sheet-generated landscapes on Earth appear if not influenced by pre-existing channeling, topography, and structure of bedrock? Considering the morphology of Kasei Valles, might regolith have supported the generation of its ideally-shaped streamlined landforms akin to the well-formed islands of glacial spillways, yet through the processes of large-scale glacial erosion evidenced by its extant areal scour indicative of wet-based erosion? Discussion: There are examples of terrestrial ice sheet-generated landforms for which landscape consid-erations might explain the above mentioned disparity.  Fig. 1a shows Kasei Valles, an erosional landform net-work comprised of interconnected or anastomosing channels or troughs, supposedly breached and non-breached streamlined landforms, and valley-wide areal scour. Thought to be a flood or glacial spillway chan-nel system, Kasei Valles is here interpreted as a set of glacial troughs and streamlined landforms, likely erod-ed by sub-polar ice sheets [1]. A terrestrial analog can be seen in Fig. 1b. It shows a portion of eastern Ellesmere Island recently exposed by the retreating ice sheet where several streamlined landforms are visible among a network of interconnected glacial troughs. Though the landforms at Kasei Valles are more curvi-linear, whereas more angular at Ellesmere, this could be explained by the uniform and easily eroded regolith, compared to the structured and resistant bedrock. Also, the widespread areal scour at Kasei Valles (Fig. 2), which extends over most streamlined forms, is more consistent with the uniform areal scour typical of ice sheets than the more spatially variable and local-ized erosion typical of the generally more focused ero-sion caused by floods. This is because the pressure melting point within ice sheets (see explanation below) promotes sheet-like erosion, except where geologic and topographic factors promote channelization.  The erosion of the exposed landscape at Ellesmere Island occurred at the base of the nearby ice sheet be-fore it retreated. Although related to intermediate-scale asymmetric and symmetric erosional landforms such as roches mountennees, whalebacks, rock drumlins, and crag and tails, the scale of the landforms are more consistent with \u201clarge-scale selective linear erosion\u201d associated with sub-polar ice sheets, which are cold-based where thinner and warm-based where thick enough [1]. Ice streams within the ice sheet slid across the bedrock with varying velocities, both spatially and temporally, to erode the anastomosing network of troughs. Although inundated by the ice sheet, the streamlined landforms were marked by relatively less basal sliding and erosion than the troughs, having been overlain by thinner, slower moving or stagnant cold-based ice. Similarly, \u201cnon-breached\u201d streamlined land-forms at Kasei Valles may have been inundated by cold-based ice, but were spared the erosion evidenced by the areal scour of adjacent lower topography. The causes of these spatial variations of erosion are better understood if one imagines the pressure melting point, where sliding may occur, as a dynamic, 3-di-mensional layer at depth, controlled by ice thickness   and basal and flow variations [1, 2]. Erosion principal-ly occurs beneath thicker ice where the pressure melt-ing point is met, where warmed by geothermal heat flux, frictional heating, and through heat transfer by water. As erosion continues, enhanced by positive feedback through increasing frictional heating and ice thickness, subglacial troughs lengthen, widen, deepen, and even connect, influenced by parameters such as topography, pre-existing channelling, and faults. Also, as ice flows from a given area, the ice thins and the pressure melting point may drop below the ground surface, causing sliding to cease and flow velocities to decrease in that area. These positive and negative feedback mechanisms cause an ice sheet to maintain a sheet like flow, yet erode troughs where velocities are highest. Anastomosing of troughs result from long-term fluctuations in ice drainage patterns within an ice sheet, represented by linked-flow networks or evolving or switching time-transgressive flow patterns.  In line with these considerations and other morpho-logical interpretations, including those previously pre-sented elsewhere [3, 4, 5], I argue for a sub-polar ice sheet-based interpretation of Kasei Valles, in which variable and widespread erosion induced areal scour and stripped regolith to leave behind its streamlined 1006.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)landform and trough system. This possible glacial ori-gin of Kasei Valles is related globally to other valley systems on Mars in an previous abstract and an associ-ated poster paper, which outlines ongoing research [6].

D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it;.        Introduction: Lunar mare domes are smooth low features with gentle convex upward profiles. In this contribution we provide an analysis of three effusive domes located in the eastern lunar regions near crater Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F, which have previously not been examined in detail. The first examined dome is located at longitude 25.44\u00ba E and latitude 52.24\u00ba N with a base diameter of 6.0 km (Fig. 1). It is a previously unreported dome, which we named Aristoteles 1 (Aris1). Another dome, bisected by Rimae Daniell, located at 24.86\u00b0 E and 38.45\u00b0 N and having a diameter of 9 km, has been termed Plana G1 (P1). It displays three protrusions which probably are pre-existing non-volcanic hills. The third examined dome is situated to the north of P1 and to the east of Plana F, at longitude 39.32\u00b0 E and latitude 13.50\u00b0 N, and has a diameter of 7 km (Fig. 2, dome termed P2).       Spectral properties: For both domes, Clementine  UVVIS spectral data indicate a R415/R750 ratio of about  0.56-0.57 indicating basalts of low TiO2 content and furthermore reveal a 750 nm reflectance of R750 = 0.13 for P1-P2 and 0.16 for Aris1, and a weak mafic absorption for two domes in Lacus Somniorum with R950/R750 = 1.06, suggesting a high soil maturity. The dome Aris1 has a lower R950/R750 ratio of 1.01 (Fig. 3).   Fig. 1. Aristoteles 1 dome marked with arrows.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [5], which depends on the morphometric dome properties, yields estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morphometric values listed in Table 1, we obtained lava viscosities between 8.8 x 104 and 3.0 x 106 Pa s, effusion rates between 60 and 75 m3 s-1, and durations of the effusion process between 0.6 and 2.5 years (Table 2). Furthermore, we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L) according to the model developed in [6]. We found that the magma ascended at speeds between 2.0 x 10- 5 and 6.8 x 10-6 m s-1 through dikes of widths between about 20 and 65 m (Table 2). The dome Aris1 is a typical representative of rheologic group R1 as defined in [1], characterised by lava viscosities of 104-106 Pa s, magma rise speeds U of 10-5-10-3 m s-1, dike widths W around 10-20 m, and dike lengths L between about 30 and 150 km. Rheologic group R2 is characterised by low lava viscosities between 102 and 104 Pa s, fast magma ascent (U > 10-3 m s-1), narrow (W = 1-4 m) and short (L = 7-20 km) feeder dikes. The third group, R3, is made up of domes which formed from highly viscous lavas of 106-108 Pa s, ascending at very low speeds of 10-6-10-5 m s-1 through broad dikes of several tens to 200 m width and 100-200 km length. The domes P1 and P2 are typical representatives of rheologic group R3. Hence, for three examined domes the magma reservoirs are located well below the lunar crust regarding the thicknesses of the total crust of about 55 km [7].     References: [1] W\u00f6hler et al.

In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1.

Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0\u00b0, 0.64\u00b0 and 0.54\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model devel-oped in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the 1001.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 104 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~103 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m-3. The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we esti-mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-3-10-4 m s-1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

Lena1 and Barry Fitz-Gerald2- Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it ; 2 79 South Court Ave, Dorchester, Dorset, DT12DA United Kingdom barryfitz_gerald@hotmail.com       Introduction: To the north-east of the crater Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

V.A. Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

C. Floss1 and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous alteration [1\u20133], and have been found in abundance only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but contains unique features that distinguish it from typical CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is that it appears to have undergone a unique style of highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).   Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix from MIL 07687. In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the secondary alteration it has experienced. Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 33,900 \u00b5m2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively unaltered Fe-poor matrix. Following isotopic identification of the grains, we used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major element compositions of the grains, following standard procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 110 \u00b1 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 \u00b1 19 ppm for SiC, in good agreement with the abundances determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges and medians observed for presolar silicates from primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 [e.g., 1 and references therein]. Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or akagan\u00e9ite [7, 8].  Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from MIL 07687. The results of our imaging survey indicate that presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. However, we do see some differences in the presolar grain abundances between the two types of matrix. Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered ones. However, the difference is not as large as might be expected given that presolar silicates are more susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar grain types. In addition to the difference in abundance, we observe compositional differences in the presolar silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which have a factor of two higher median Fe content than presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.  Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains per 1000 \u00b5m2) in MIL 07687. Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2. This difference is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration. References: [1] Floss and Stadermann (2012) MAPS 47, 992.

C. Floss. Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: In addition to the first unambiguous cometary samples, from comet 81P/Wild 2 [1], NASA\u2019s Stardust mission was designed to collect the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust. The Stardust interstellar dust collector collected particles for 229 days during two exposures prior to the spacecraft encounter with Wild 2 and tracked the interstellar dust stream for all but 34 days of that time. The Al foils make up ~15% of the total collection surface and about 12-15 particles, with 2/3 of those less than ~1 \u00b5m in size, were expected to have impacted the available Al foil area. The initial investigation of these samples took place under the auspices of the CAPTEM-approved Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE). The ISPE proposed to carry out non-destructive, non-invasive searches for, and analyses of, interstellar dust candidates in the Stardust interstellar tray and focused on two parallel investigations: extraction and analysis of tracks in aerogel identified through Stardust@home, and search for and characterization of impact craters in the aluminum foils [2].  The work of the ISPE team resulted in the discovery and characterization of seven probable  interstellar dust particles [3], four of which were identified from impact craters in the Al foil [4]. At the formal conclusion of the ISPE two years ago, only ~5% of the available Al foil area had been measured. We have continued the work of scanning Al foils from the Stardust interstellar tray in order to identify additional interstellar dust candidates. Here we report the results of our work to date. Experimental: Foil scanning is done in automated mode using the JEOL 840a SEM at Washington University. By combining our instrument control software with custom written software, we are able to automatically map an entire foil in a single (long) run. Foils are divided into multiple grids of about 0.25 mm2. Manual z-axis focusing is done in the center of each region, after which the grids are further divided into individual images 106 x 80 \u00b5m in size. The z-axis positions are interpolated from one grid center to the next to ensure good focus for all individual images in a grid and the x, y, and z coordinates are individually stored. The images are mapped at 15 kV, 5 nA for 10 sec per frame, providing a resolution of ~50 nm/pixel with a dwell time of 0.001 sec/\u00b5m2. The entire array is imaged automatically in sequence, and each image is saved with a unique label identifying its position on the foil.  Images from the foils (~5000 for short foils and ~10,000 for long foils) are manually examined independently by at least two undergraduate students, and the candidate craters identified are subsequently ranked. The most likely candidates are then imaged at higher resolution to ascertain which are actual impact craters. Results: We have scanned a total of four long (N) foils and two short (W) foils: 1010N, 1031N, 1032W, 1047N, 1061N and 1063W. Image examination is still in progress on foil 1010N, but we have identified a feature on this foil that appears to be an unusually large impact crater (Fig. 1). However, additional analysis (e.g., Auger spectroscopy and/or FIB/TEM) will be needed to confirm the identification. A similar feature found on foil 1047N during the ISPE ultimately turned out to be a hole created during the foil flattening process [4].  Figure 1. Secondary electron image 314@43 from interstellar foil 1010N,1. The impact feature is approximately 4 \u00b5m in diameter. Approximately 2700 candidate craters were identified from the other foils, of which 1125 were selected for higher resolution imaging. Table 1 shows the resulting 19 likely impact craters. Eleven of these were investigated as part of the ISPE [4]; the remaining eight are shown in Fig. 2. While some are clear impact craters, others are more ambiguous and, like 314@43 mentioned above, will require additional analysis for confirmation. Outlook:  The number of impact craters identified on individual foils is clearly highly variable and the foils examined by our laboratory as part of the ISPE fortuitously contained a relatively high proportion of craters. Moreover, many of the potential new impact 1005.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)features shown in Fig. 2 are unconventional compared to \u2018traditional craters\u2019 and it remains to be seen whether compositional analyses can confirm an extraterrestrial or even secondary impact origin for these features. Despite these obstacles, the results of the ISPE demonstrate that continued scanning and examination of the Al foils on the interstellar collector has the potential to provide important new information about contemporary interstellar dust.

John D. Arfstrom, jarfstrom@gmail.com, www.JohnArfstrom.com, 904.200.2619. Introduction: Terrestrial anastomosing glacial troughs and streamlined landforms matching the ideal-ly formed channel systems of Mars are lacking. The disparate geology and topography of Earth and Mars may well have variably influenced the erosion of such landforms, which are probably more ideally formed on Mars due to the spatial uniformity and erodibility of the wide expanses of crater scarred, pristine regolith plains. Likewise, the circular ramparts that craters present against the onslaught of erosion, compared to the random forms typical on Earth, would be reflected in the geometries of eroded forms. An important ques-tion to be addressed is: how would ice sheet-generated landscapes on Earth appear if not influenced by pre-existing channeling, topography, and structure of bedrock? Considering the morphology of Kasei Valles, might regolith have supported the generation of its ideally-shaped streamlined landforms akin to the well-formed islands of glacial spillways, yet through the processes of large-scale glacial erosion evidenced by its extant areal scour indicative of wet-based erosion? Discussion: There are examples of terrestrial ice sheet-generated landforms for which landscape consid-erations might explain the above mentioned disparity.  Fig. 1a shows Kasei Valles, an erosional landform net-work comprised of interconnected or anastomosing channels or troughs, supposedly breached and non-breached streamlined landforms, and valley-wide areal scour. Thought to be a flood or glacial spillway chan-nel system, Kasei Valles is here interpreted as a set of glacial troughs and streamlined landforms, likely erod-ed by sub-polar ice sheets [1]. A terrestrial analog can be seen in Fig. 1b. It shows a portion of eastern Ellesmere Island recently exposed by the retreating ice sheet where several streamlined landforms are visible among a network of interconnected glacial troughs. Though the landforms at Kasei Valles are more curvi-linear, whereas more angular at Ellesmere, this could be explained by the uniform and easily eroded regolith, compared to the structured and resistant bedrock. Also, the widespread areal scour at Kasei Valles (Fig. 2), which extends over most streamlined forms, is more consistent with the uniform areal scour typical of ice sheets than the more spatially variable and local-ized erosion typical of the generally more focused ero-sion caused by floods. This is because the pressure melting point within ice sheets (see explanation below) promotes sheet-like erosion, except where geologic and topographic factors promote channelization.  The erosion of the exposed landscape at Ellesmere Island occurred at the base of the nearby ice sheet be-fore it retreated. Although related to intermediate-scale asymmetric and symmetric erosional landforms such as roches mountennees, whalebacks, rock drumlins, and crag and tails, the scale of the landforms are more consistent with \u201clarge-scale selective linear erosion\u201d associated with sub-polar ice sheets, which are cold-based where thinner and warm-based where thick enough [1]. Ice streams within the ice sheet slid across the bedrock with varying velocities, both spatially and temporally, to erode the anastomosing network of troughs. Although inundated by the ice sheet, the streamlined landforms were marked by relatively less basal sliding and erosion than the troughs, having been overlain by thinner, slower moving or stagnant cold-based ice. Similarly, \u201cnon-breached\u201d streamlined land-forms at Kasei Valles may have been inundated by cold-based ice, but were spared the erosion evidenced by the areal scour of adjacent lower topography. The causes of these spatial variations of erosion are better understood if one imagines the pressure melting point, where sliding may occur, as a dynamic, 3-di-mensional layer at depth, controlled by ice thickness   and basal and flow variations [1, 2]. Erosion principal-ly occurs beneath thicker ice where the pressure melt-ing point is met, where warmed by geothermal heat flux, frictional heating, and through heat transfer by water. As erosion continues, enhanced by positive feedback through increasing frictional heating and ice thickness, subglacial troughs lengthen, widen, deepen, and even connect, influenced by parameters such as topography, pre-existing channelling, and faults. Also, as ice flows from a given area, the ice thins and the pressure melting point may drop below the ground surface, causing sliding to cease and flow velocities to decrease in that area. These positive and negative feedback mechanisms cause an ice sheet to maintain a sheet like flow, yet erode troughs where velocities are highest. Anastomosing of troughs result from long-term fluctuations in ice drainage patterns within an ice sheet, represented by linked-flow networks or evolving or switching time-transgressive flow patterns.  In line with these considerations and other morpho-logical interpretations, including those previously pre-sented elsewhere [3, 4, 5], I argue for a sub-polar ice sheet-based interpretation of Kasei Valles, in which variable and widespread erosion induced areal scour and stripped regolith to leave behind its streamlined 1006.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)landform and trough system. This possible glacial ori-gin of Kasei Valles is related globally to other valley systems on Mars in an previous abstract and an associ-ated poster paper, which outlines ongoing research [6].

D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it;.        Introduction: Lunar mare domes are smooth low features with gentle convex upward profiles. In this contribution we provide an analysis of three effusive domes located in the eastern lunar regions near crater Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F, which have previously not been examined in detail. The first examined dome is located at longitude 25.44\u00ba E and latitude 52.24\u00ba N with a base diameter of 6.0 km (Fig. 1). It is a previously unreported dome, which we named Aristoteles 1 (Aris1). Another dome, bisected by Rimae Daniell, located at 24.86\u00b0 E and 38.45\u00b0 N and having a diameter of 9 km, has been termed Plana G1 (P1). It displays three protrusions which probably are pre-existing non-volcanic hills. The third examined dome is situated to the north of P1 and to the east of Plana F, at longitude 39.32\u00b0 E and latitude 13.50\u00b0 N, and has a diameter of 7 km (Fig. 2, dome termed P2).       Spectral properties: For both domes, Clementine  UVVIS spectral data indicate a R415/R750 ratio of about  0.56-0.57 indicating basalts of low TiO2 content and furthermore reveal a 750 nm reflectance of R750 = 0.13 for P1-P2 and 0.16 for Aris1, and a weak mafic absorption for two domes in Lacus Somniorum with R950/R750 = 1.06, suggesting a high soil maturity. The dome Aris1 has a lower R950/R750 ratio of 1.01 (Fig. 3).   Fig. 1. Aristoteles 1 dome marked with arrows.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [5], which depends on the morphometric dome properties, yields estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morphometric values listed in Table 1, we obtained lava viscosities between 8.8 x 104 and 3.0 x 106 Pa s, effusion rates between 60 and 75 m3 s-1, and durations of the effusion process between 0.6 and 2.5 years (Table 2). Furthermore, we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L) according to the model developed in [6]. We found that the magma ascended at speeds between 2.0 x 10- 5 and 6.8 x 10-6 m s-1 through dikes of widths between about 20 and 65 m (Table 2). The dome Aris1 is a typical representative of rheologic group R1 as defined in [1], characterised by lava viscosities of 104-106 Pa s, magma rise speeds U of 10-5-10-3 m s-1, dike widths W around 10-20 m, and dike lengths L between about 30 and 150 km. Rheologic group R2 is characterised by low lava viscosities between 102 and 104 Pa s, fast magma ascent (U > 10-3 m s-1), narrow (W = 1-4 m) and short (L = 7-20 km) feeder dikes. The third group, R3, is made up of domes which formed from highly viscous lavas of 106-108 Pa s, ascending at very low speeds of 10-6-10-5 m s-1 through broad dikes of several tens to 200 m width and 100-200 km length. The domes P1 and P2 are typical representatives of rheologic group R3. Hence, for three examined domes the magma reservoirs are located well below the lunar crust regarding the thicknesses of the total crust of about 55 km [7].     References: [1] W\u00f6hler et al.

Introduction: Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes are some the largest volcanoes on Mars and in our Solar System. Our team is funded by NASA\u2019s Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP) to complete a set of 1:1,000,000 geologic maps of Olympus, Arsia, Pavonis, and Ascraeus based on the mapping style defined by [1,2]. Figure 1 shows the area around each volcano that we are funded to map, including additional sections that cover the rift aprons and small vent fields. Detailed mapping of a limited area of these volcanoes revealed a diverse distribution of volcanic landforms within the calderas, and along the flanks, rift aprons, and surrounding plains [1]. Here, we report on the progress of each map.   Figure 1. MOLA shaded relief map with the bounda-ries (solid lines) for each map and extensions (dashed lines) to cover rift aprons and small vent fields.  Data and Methods: We are mapping each vol-cano in ArcMap 9 and 10.2 to produce digital geo-logic maps at 1:1,000,000 map scale for the USGS. A Context Camera (CTX) mosaic serves as the primary basemap, supplemented by High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), THEMIS daytime IR, HiRISE, and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data. To ad-dress our science questions we have conducted our mapping at ~1:300,000 to ~1:100,000 on the CTX basemap. This scale enables us to distinguish be-tween different morphologic features like sinuous rilles, leveed channels, low shields, and surface tex-tures (hummocky, mottled, smooth), plus we are able to determine flow margins, flow directions, and strat-igraphic relationships between different eruption sequences. Our primary objective for each map is to show the areal extent, distribution, and stratigraphic relationships of the different volcanic morphologies to better understand the changes in effusive style across each volcano and provide insight into the similarities and differences in their evolution. Mapping Progress: Each map is in a different stage of the geologic mapping process. The Ascraeus Mons map is the most recently funded project and we will begin preliminary mapping in 2015. The maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes are also nearing comple-tion and should be ready to submit for publication by mid to late 2015 (Fig. 2). The Olympus Mons map has complete line work and is being prepared for submission to the USGS for publication (Fig. 3). For the Tharsis Montes, our objective this year is to map the contacts between different volcanic provinces on each volcano (e.g., main shield, rift aprons, and lava plains). We have mapped the surficial fan deposits on Pavonis and Arsia Mons using sketch maps from [4-6] as guides for mapping similar units (e.g., smooth, ridged, knobby). See Dapremont et al., this meeting [Abstract #1605] for detailed mapping of the Arsia Mons fan shaped deposit.  Figure 2. Maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes1008.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Discussion:  Our current progress has provided sev-eral insights into the eruption processes and evolu-tion of these volcanoes. Geologic Units: The current mapping units have evolved from the original proposed mapping units to correspond with units used for the recent geologic map of Olympus Mons [6] (Fig. 3).  Detailed image-ry from CTX has allowed us to diversify the units based on various eruption styles. The units are dis-tinguished primarily by morphology and are grouped for each edifice (main shield, rift apron, fan deposit, lava plains). General Formation Sequence: Mapping reveals a similar sequence of events for the evolution of the three Tharsis Montes volcanoes [1,2,8]: 1) main shield forms, 2) eruptions from the NE/SW rifts em-place long lava flows that surround the main flank, 3) eruptions wane and build up the rift aprons and shield fields, 4) glaciers deposit surficial fan deposit material [9], and 5) localized recent eruptions along the main flanks, in the calderas, and within the fan-shaped deposits. Further mapping will reveal the relative geologic timing of eruptive units on the main shields and provide a more complete analysis of the spatial distribution of tube-fed versus channel-fed flows for each volcano and how they compare with Olympus Mons as originally discussed by [1].

In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1. Telescopic image acquired on July 9, 2014, at 03:34 UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian (M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image.       Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0\u00b0, 0.64\u00b0 and 0.54\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model devel-oped in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the 1001.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 104 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~103 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m-3. The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we esti-mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-3-10-4 m s-1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

Lena1 and Barry Fitz-Gerald2- Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it ; 2 79 South Court Ave, Dorchester, Dorset, DT12DA United Kingdom barryfitz_gerald@hotmail.com       Introduction: To the north-east of the crater Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

V.A. Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

C. Floss1 and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous alteration [1\u20133], and have been found in abundance only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but contains unique features that distinguish it from typical CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is that it appears to have undergone a unique style of highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).   Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix from MIL 07687. In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the secondary alteration it has experienced. Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 33,900 \u00b5m2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively unaltered Fe-poor matrix. Following isotopic identification of the grains, we used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major element compositions of the grains, following standard procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 110 \u00b1 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 \u00b1 19 ppm for SiC, in good agreement with the abundances determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges and medians observed for presolar silicates from primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 [e.g., 1 and references therein]. Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or akagan\u00e9ite [7, 8].  Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from MIL 07687. The results of our imaging survey indicate that presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. However, we do see some differences in the presolar grain abundances between the two types of matrix. Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered ones. However, the difference is not as large as might be expected given that presolar silicates are more susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar grain types. In addition to the difference in abundance, we observe compositional differences in the presolar silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which have a factor of two higher median Fe content than presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.  Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains per 1000 \u00b5m2) in MIL 07687. Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2. This difference is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration. References: [1] Floss and Stadermann (2012) MAPS 47, 992.

C. Floss. Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: In addition to the first unambiguous cometary samples, from comet 81P/Wild 2 [1], NASA\u2019s Stardust mission was designed to collect the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust. The Stardust interstellar dust collector collected particles for 229 days during two exposures prior to the spacecraft encounter with Wild 2 and tracked the interstellar dust stream for all but 34 days of that time. The Al foils make up ~15% of the total collection surface and about 12-15 particles, with 2/3 of those less than ~1 \u00b5m in size, were expected to have impacted the available Al foil area. The initial investigation of these samples took place under the auspices of the CAPTEM-approved Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE). The ISPE proposed to carry out non-destructive, non-invasive searches for, and analyses of, interstellar dust candidates in the Stardust interstellar tray and focused on two parallel investigations: extraction and analysis of tracks in aerogel identified through Stardust@home, and search for and characterization of impact craters in the aluminum foils [2].  The work of the ISPE team resulted in the discovery and characterization of seven probable  interstellar dust particles [3], four of which were identified from impact craters in the Al foil [4]. At the formal conclusion of the ISPE two years ago, only ~5% of the available Al foil area had been measured. We have continued the work of scanning Al foils from the Stardust interstellar tray in order to identify additional interstellar dust candidates. Here we report the results of our work to date. Experimental: Foil scanning is done in automated mode using the JEOL 840a SEM at Washington University. By combining our instrument control software with custom written software, we are able to automatically map an entire foil in a single (long) run. Foils are divided into multiple grids of about 0.25 mm2. Manual z-axis focusing is done in the center of each region, after which the grids are further divided into individual images 106 x 80 \u00b5m in size. The z-axis positions are interpolated from one grid center to the next to ensure good focus for all individual images in a grid and the x, y, and z coordinates are individually stored. The images are mapped at 15 kV, 5 nA for 10 sec per frame, providing a resolution of ~50 nm/pixel with a dwell time of 0.001 sec/\u00b5m2. The entire array is imaged automatically in sequence, and each image is saved with a unique label identifying its position on the foil.  Images from the foils (~5000 for short foils and ~10,000 for long foils) are manually examined independently by at least two undergraduate students, and the candidate craters identified are subsequently ranked. The most likely candidates are then imaged at higher resolution to ascertain which are actual impact craters. Results: We have scanned a total of four long (N) foils and two short (W) foils: 1010N, 1031N, 1032W, 1047N, 1061N and 1063W. Image examination is still in progress on foil 1010N, but we have identified a feature on this foil that appears to be an unusually large impact crater (Fig. 1). However, additional analysis (e.g., Auger spectroscopy and/or FIB/TEM) will be needed to confirm the identification. A similar feature found on foil 1047N during the ISPE ultimately turned out to be a hole created during the foil flattening process [4].  Figure 1. Secondary electron image 314@43 from interstellar foil 1010N,1. The impact feature is approximately 4 \u00b5m in diameter. Approximately 2700 candidate craters were identified from the other foils, of which 1125 were selected for higher resolution imaging. Table 1 shows the resulting 19 likely impact craters. Eleven of these were investigated as part of the ISPE [4]; the remaining eight are shown in Fig. 2. While some are clear impact craters, others are more ambiguous and, like 314@43 mentioned above, will require additional analysis for confirmation. Outlook:  The number of impact craters identified on individual foils is clearly highly variable and the foils examined by our laboratory as part of the ISPE fortuitously contained a relatively high proportion of craters. Moreover, many of the potential new impact 1005.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)features shown in Fig. 2 are unconventional compared to \u2018traditional craters\u2019 and it remains to be seen whether compositional analyses can confirm an extraterrestrial or even secondary impact origin for these features. Despite these obstacles, the results of the ISPE demonstrate that continued scanning and examination of the Al foils on the interstellar collector has the potential to provide important new information about contemporary interstellar dust.

John D. Arfstrom, jarfstrom@gmail.com, www.JohnArfstrom.com, 904.200.2619. Introduction: Terrestrial anastomosing glacial troughs and streamlined landforms matching the ideal-ly formed channel systems of Mars are lacking. The disparate geology and topography of Earth and Mars may well have variably influenced the erosion of such landforms, which are probably more ideally formed on Mars due to the spatial uniformity and erodibility of the wide expanses of crater scarred, pristine regolith plains. Likewise, the circular ramparts that craters present against the onslaught of erosion, compared to the random forms typical on Earth, would be reflected in the geometries of eroded forms. An important ques-tion to be addressed is: how would ice sheet-generated landscapes on Earth appear if not influenced by pre-existing channeling, topography, and structure of bedrock? Considering the morphology of Kasei Valles, might regolith have supported the generation of its ideally-shaped streamlined landforms akin to the well-formed islands of glacial spillways, yet through the processes of large-scale glacial erosion evidenced by its extant areal scour indicative of wet-based erosion? Discussion: There are examples of terrestrial ice sheet-generated landforms for which landscape consid-erations might explain the above mentioned disparity.  Fig. 1a shows Kasei Valles, an erosional landform net-work comprised of interconnected or anastomosing channels or troughs, supposedly breached and non-breached streamlined landforms, and valley-wide areal scour. Thought to be a flood or glacial spillway chan-nel system, Kasei Valles is here interpreted as a set of glacial troughs and streamlined landforms, likely erod-ed by sub-polar ice sheets [1]. A terrestrial analog can be seen in Fig. 1b. It shows a portion of eastern Ellesmere Island recently exposed by the retreating ice sheet where several streamlined landforms are visible among a network of interconnected glacial troughs. Though the landforms at Kasei Valles are more curvi-linear, whereas more angular at Ellesmere, this could be explained by the uniform and easily eroded regolith, compared to the structured and resistant bedrock. Also, the widespread areal scour at Kasei Valles (Fig. 2), which extends over most streamlined forms, is more consistent with the uniform areal scour typical of ice sheets than the more spatially variable and local-ized erosion typical of the generally more focused ero-sion caused by floods. This is because the pressure melting point within ice sheets (see explanation below) promotes sheet-like erosion, except where geologic and topographic factors promote channelization.  The erosion of the exposed landscape at Ellesmere Island occurred at the base of the nearby ice sheet be-fore it retreated. Although related to intermediate-scale asymmetric and symmetric erosional landforms such as roches mountennees, whalebacks, rock drumlins, and crag and tails, the scale of the landforms are more consistent with \u201clarge-scale selective linear erosion\u201d associated with sub-polar ice sheets, which are cold-based where thinner and warm-based where thick enough [1]. Ice streams within the ice sheet slid across the bedrock with varying velocities, both spatially and temporally, to erode the anastomosing network of troughs. Although inundated by the ice sheet, the streamlined landforms were marked by relatively less basal sliding and erosion than the troughs, having been overlain by thinner, slower moving or stagnant cold-based ice. Similarly, \u201cnon-breached\u201d streamlined land-forms at Kasei Valles may have been inundated by cold-based ice, but were spared the erosion evidenced by the areal scour of adjacent lower topography. The causes of these spatial variations of erosion are better understood if one imagines the pressure melting point, where sliding may occur, as a dynamic, 3-di-mensional layer at depth, controlled by ice thickness   and basal and flow variations [1, 2]. Erosion principal-ly occurs beneath thicker ice where the pressure melt-ing point is met, where warmed by geothermal heat flux, frictional heating, and through heat transfer by water. As erosion continues, enhanced by positive feedback through increasing frictional heating and ice thickness, subglacial troughs lengthen, widen, deepen, and even connect, influenced by parameters such as topography, pre-existing channelling, and faults. Also, as ice flows from a given area, the ice thins and the pressure melting point may drop below the ground surface, causing sliding to cease and flow velocities to decrease in that area. These positive and negative feedback mechanisms cause an ice sheet to maintain a sheet like flow, yet erode troughs where velocities are highest. Anastomosing of troughs result from long-term fluctuations in ice drainage patterns within an ice sheet, represented by linked-flow networks or evolving or switching time-transgressive flow patterns.  In line with these considerations and other morpho-logical interpretations, including those previously pre-sented elsewhere [3, 4, 5], I argue for a sub-polar ice sheet-based interpretation of Kasei Valles, in which variable and widespread erosion induced areal scour and stripped regolith to leave behind its streamlined 1006.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)landform and trough system. This possible glacial ori-gin of Kasei Valles is related globally to other valley systems on Mars in an previous abstract and an associ-ated poster paper, which outlines ongoing research [6].

D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it;.        Introduction: Lunar mare domes are smooth low features with gentle convex upward profiles. In this contribution we provide an analysis of three effusive domes located in the eastern lunar regions near crater Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F, which have previously not been examined in detail. The first examined dome is located at longitude 25.44\u00ba E and latitude 52.24\u00ba N with a base diameter of 6.0 km (Fig. 1). It is a previously unreported dome, which we named Aristoteles 1 (Aris1). Another dome, bisected by Rimae Daniell, located at 24.86\u00b0 E and 38.45\u00b0 N and having a diameter of 9 km, has been termed Plana G1 (P1). It displays three protrusions which probably are pre-existing non-volcanic hills. The third examined dome is situated to the north of P1 and to the east of Plana F, at longitude 39.32\u00b0 E and latitude 13.50\u00b0 N, and has a diameter of 7 km (Fig. 2, dome termed P2).       Spectral properties: For both domes, Clementine  UVVIS spectral data indicate a R415/R750 ratio of about  0.56-0.57 indicating basalts of low TiO2 content and furthermore reveal a 750 nm reflectance of R750 = 0.13 for P1-P2 and 0.16 for Aris1, and a weak mafic absorption for two domes in Lacus Somniorum with R950/R750 = 1.06, suggesting a high soil maturity. The dome Aris1 has a lower R950/R750 ratio of 1.01 (Fig. 3).   Fig. 1. Aristoteles 1 dome marked with arrows.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [5], which depends on the morphometric dome properties, yields estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morphometric values listed in Table 1, we obtained lava viscosities between 8.8 x 104 and 3.0 x 106 Pa s, effusion rates between 60 and 75 m3 s-1, and durations of the effusion process between 0.6 and 2.5 years (Table 2). Furthermore, we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L) according to the model developed in [6]. We found that the magma ascended at speeds between 2.0 x 10- 5 and 6.8 x 10-6 m s-1 through dikes of widths between about 20 and 65 m (Table 2). The dome Aris1 is a typical representative of rheologic group R1 as defined in [1], characterised by lava viscosities of 104-106 Pa s, magma rise speeds U of 10-5-10-3 m s-1, dike widths W around 10-20 m, and dike lengths L between about 30 and 150 km. Rheologic group R2 is characterised by low lava viscosities between 102 and 104 Pa s, fast magma ascent (U > 10-3 m s-1), narrow (W = 1-4 m) and short (L = 7-20 km) feeder dikes. The third group, R3, is made up of domes which formed from highly viscous lavas of 106-108 Pa s, ascending at very low speeds of 10-6-10-5 m s-1 through broad dikes of several tens to 200 m width and 100-200 km length. The domes P1 and P2 are typical representatives of rheologic group R3. Hence, for three examined domes the magma reservoirs are located well below the lunar crust regarding the thicknesses of the total crust of about 55 km [7].     References: [1] W\u00f6hler et al.

Introduction: Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes are some the largest volcanoes on Mars and in our Solar System. Our team is funded by NASA\u2019s Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP) to complete a set of 1:1,000,000 geologic maps of Olympus, Arsia, Pavonis, and Ascraeus based on the mapping style defined by [1,2]. Figure 1 shows the area around each volcano that we are funded to map, including additional sections that cover the rift aprons and small vent fields. Detailed mapping of a limited area of these volcanoes revealed a diverse distribution of volcanic landforms within the calderas, and along the flanks, rift aprons, and surrounding plains [1]. Here, we report on the progress of each map.   Figure 1. MOLA shaded relief map with the bounda-ries (solid lines) for each map and extensions (dashed lines) to cover rift aprons and small vent fields.  Data and Methods: We are mapping each vol-cano in ArcMap 9 and 10.2 to produce digital geo-logic maps at 1:1,000,000 map scale for the USGS. A Context Camera (CTX) mosaic serves as the primary basemap, supplemented by High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), THEMIS daytime IR, HiRISE, and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data. To ad-dress our science questions we have conducted our mapping at ~1:300,000 to ~1:100,000 on the CTX basemap. This scale enables us to distinguish be-tween different morphologic features like sinuous rilles, leveed channels, low shields, and surface tex-tures (hummocky, mottled, smooth), plus we are able to determine flow margins, flow directions, and strat-igraphic relationships between different eruption sequences. Our primary objective for each map is to show the areal extent, distribution, and stratigraphic relationships of the different volcanic morphologies to better understand the changes in effusive style across each volcano and provide insight into the similarities and differences in their evolution. Mapping Progress: Each map is in a different stage of the geologic mapping process. The Ascraeus Mons map is the most recently funded project and we will begin preliminary mapping in 2015. The maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes are also nearing comple-tion and should be ready to submit for publication by mid to late 2015 (Fig. 2). The Olympus Mons map has complete line work and is being prepared for submission to the USGS for publication (Fig. 3). For the Tharsis Montes, our objective this year is to map the contacts between different volcanic provinces on each volcano (e.g., main shield, rift aprons, and lava plains). We have mapped the surficial fan deposits on Pavonis and Arsia Mons using sketch maps from [4-6] as guides for mapping similar units (e.g., smooth, ridged, knobby). See Dapremont et al., this meeting [Abstract #1605] for detailed mapping of the Arsia Mons fan shaped deposit.  Figure 2. Maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes1008.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Discussion:  Our current progress has provided sev-eral insights into the eruption processes and evolu-tion of these volcanoes. Geologic Units: The current mapping units have evolved from the original proposed mapping units to correspond with units used for the recent geologic map of Olympus Mons [6] (Fig. 3).  Detailed image-ry from CTX has allowed us to diversify the units based on various eruption styles. The units are dis-tinguished primarily by morphology and are grouped for each edifice (main shield, rift apron, fan deposit, lava plains). General Formation Sequence: Mapping reveals a similar sequence of events for the evolution of the three Tharsis Montes volcanoes [1,2,8]: 1) main shield forms, 2) eruptions from the NE/SW rifts em-place long lava flows that surround the main flank, 3) eruptions wane and build up the rift aprons and shield fields, 4) glaciers deposit surficial fan deposit material [9], and 5) localized recent eruptions along the main flanks, in the calderas, and within the fan-shaped deposits. Further mapping will reveal the relative geologic timing of eruptive units on the main shields and provide a more complete analysis of the spatial distribution of tube-fed versus channel-fed flows for each volcano and how they compare with Olympus Mons as originally discussed by [1].

Introduction: Lunar sinuous rilles are thought to have formed by thermal erosion, mechanical erosion, construction, or a combination of these processes via emplacement by lava tubes and/or lava channels [1-4]. The investigation of Hadley Rille by Apollo 15 pro-vided the first field observations of a rille, including outcrops of stratigraphic layers within the far rille wall  [5]. High-resolution remote sensing data sets from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter allow for the identification of smaller volcanic features, outcrops, layers, and detailed topographic measurements at the meter-scale [6,7]. Several questions relate to layers observed in the rille walls including: 1) What is their stratigraphic sequence and can individual flows be defined? 2) Are the layers a sequence of multiple, old-er eruptions that have been thermally eroded? 3) Which layers are related to the eruption that formed the rille? Each visible lineation that defines a layer, may not be a surface contact between individual flows, therefore 4) How can individual flows be distinguished within the stratigraphic sequence? and 5) What flow processes can be recognized based on characteristics of the wall rock (inflated pahoehoe) [8]?      Terrestrial volcanic features with similar morphol-ogies to lunar rilles can provide insight into their for-mation on the Moon. While the scale of most lunar rilles are much larger than their terrestrial counterparts, there are several examples similar in scale to ones we have documented in Idaho. The SSERVI FINESSE team (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System Sci-ence and Exploration) [9] conducted field studies at Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (COTM) in Idaho from July 28 \u2013 Aug. 8, 2014 to in-vestigate terrestrial analogs for lunar volcanic and im-pact features [10]. Here, we compare field observa-tions at Inferno Chasm (Figs. 1,2), a rille-like channel in Idaho to Isis (Fig. 3), a similar sized rille on the Moon.  Inferno Chasm (42\u00b058\u201900\u201dN, 113\u00b011\u201925\u201dW) is a basaltic low-shield with a vent and sinuous channel (Fig. 1). The area is overgrown with sage and desert grasses, but it appears that the margins of the low shield have been embayed or buried by subsequent lava flows or loess making it difficult to define the true extent of this volcanic feature and locate lava deposits beyond the end of the channel.   Figure 1. Inferno Chasm in Idaho. (A) Location of Differen-tial GPS and LiDAR surveys [Google Earth]. (B) Morpho-logic sketch map of key flow features and structures.    We documented the geology and morphology of Inferno Chasm using a Riegl Vz-400 LiDAR, a Trim-ble R8 and TopCon Hiper II Differential Global Posi-tioning Systems (DGPS) (Fig. 2), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and sampling. The main vent crater is roughly circular and is ~200 m wide, ~20 m deep and has a small 2.5 m-high mound in the center (Fig. 2). DGPS survey D-D\u2019 shows that the sinuous channel extends to the west while dropping ~10 m over ~1700 m, yielding a slope of -0.005\u00b0 (Fig. 2). Several over-flow channels are also visible in the remote sensing images (Fig. 1B), but are subtle in the field. For exam-ple, DGPS profile C-C\u2019 is 350 m long, 30 m wide, and 2-5 m deep. Outcrops of the vent walls expose massive layers 2-3 m thick with textures that suggest highly welded spatter overlain by a 1-2 m thick sequence of thinner layers (overspills, shelley, gaseous blisters) each 10s of cm thick. Field observations and samples collected indicate low-shield development typical of the Eastern Snake River Plains [11]. 1009.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Lunar Rilles: Isis, a rille in Serenitatis Basin (19\u00b0N, 27.5\u00b0E) (Fig. 3) has a similar morphology to Inferno Chasm. The feature is ~1.3 km wide and ~60-70 m high at the vent. The channel is ~3 km long, 283 m-wide, and 25 m deep [7]. The rille is located within high-Ti basalts and there are no identifiable deposits extending from the end of the channel. The vent is aligned with three other small cones along a north-west-southeast trending graben, possibly related to an intrusive dike. There are boulders present along the rim of the rille, but no distinct layers are visible in the images.  Figure 2. Differential GPS profiles A-A\u2019 across the vent (North to South) and D-D\u2019 along the channel floor (East to West) of Inferno Chasm (see Fig. 1A).  Discussion: Field observations of the wall material at Inferno Chasm suggest the feature was constructed through a combination of thin lava overflow, rheo-morphic flow of congealed spatter, and intense weld-ing of deeper parts, with or without additional lava injection, to form the thick, massive layers. Evidence of thermal erosion and/or lava tube collapse along the channel were not identified, but have not been ruled out. Distinct levees were not identified along the chan-nel margin, but there are linear, topographic highs near the mouth of the channel (Fig. 1B).  Isis has several similarities in both morphology and scale to Inferno Chasm. Both are topographic highs with a central channel ~2-3 km long. No distal depos-its are identified beyond each channel. Isis is atypical compared to larger sinuous rilles, like the example in Marius Hills shown in Fig. 3B. Most lunar rilles ap-pear to carve into the local terrain through thermal erosion [7]. We suggest Isis was formed by construc-tion, from a highly gaseous, fire fountain eruption that created spatter that collected to form the cone and spat-ter-fed flows rather than by thermal erosion. Observa-tions of flow textures in exposed layers and rocks can help interpret the flow processes that formed the rilles [8]. For example, the planar, vesicle horizons observed in rocks along the rim of Hadley Rille are consistent with inflated pahoehoe [8], whereas the tumultuous textures observed in the boulders and wall rock at In-ferno Chasm are consistent with welded spatter. How-ever, given the much larger scale of most lunar rilles, construction may only be a minor component of their formation. Based on the depth of a rille, assumptions on how much the wall represents eroded substrate ma-terial and which layers formed via construction is im-portant for determining parameters for thermal erosion models.

In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1. Telescopic image acquired on July 9, 2014, at 03:34 UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian (M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image.       Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0\u00b0, 0.64\u00b0 and 0.54\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

This DEM has been constructed based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.      According to the classification scheme for lunar domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 belong to class C1.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model devel-oped in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the 1001.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 104 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~103 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m-3. The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we esti-mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-3-10-4 m s-1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

Lena1 and Barry Fitz-Gerald2- Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it ; 2 79 South Court Ave, Dorchester, Dorset, DT12DA United Kingdom barryfitz_gerald@hotmail.com       Introduction: To the north-east of the crater Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

V.A. Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

C. Floss1 and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous alteration [1\u20133], and have been found in abundance only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but contains unique features that distinguish it from typical CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is that it appears to have undergone a unique style of highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).   Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix from MIL 07687. In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the secondary alteration it has experienced. Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 33,900 \u00b5m2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively unaltered Fe-poor matrix. Following isotopic identification of the grains, we used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major element compositions of the grains, following standard procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 110 \u00b1 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 \u00b1 19 ppm for SiC, in good agreement with the abundances determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges and medians observed for presolar silicates from primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 [e.g., 1 and references therein]. Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or akagan\u00e9ite [7, 8].  Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from MIL 07687. The results of our imaging survey indicate that presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. However, we do see some differences in the presolar grain abundances between the two types of matrix. Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered ones. However, the difference is not as large as might be expected given that presolar silicates are more susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar grain types. In addition to the difference in abundance, we observe compositional differences in the presolar silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which have a factor of two higher median Fe content than presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.  Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains per 1000 \u00b5m2) in MIL 07687. Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2. This difference is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration. References: [1] Floss and Stadermann (2012) MAPS 47, 992.

C. Floss. Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: In addition to the first unambiguous cometary samples, from comet 81P/Wild 2 [1], NASA\u2019s Stardust mission was designed to collect the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust. The Stardust interstellar dust collector collected particles for 229 days during two exposures prior to the spacecraft encounter with Wild 2 and tracked the interstellar dust stream for all but 34 days of that time. The Al foils make up ~15% of the total collection surface and about 12-15 particles, with 2/3 of those less than ~1 \u00b5m in size, were expected to have impacted the available Al foil area. The initial investigation of these samples took place under the auspices of the CAPTEM-approved Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE). The ISPE proposed to carry out non-destructive, non-invasive searches for, and analyses of, interstellar dust candidates in the Stardust interstellar tray and focused on two parallel investigations: extraction and analysis of tracks in aerogel identified through Stardust@home, and search for and characterization of impact craters in the aluminum foils [2].  The work of the ISPE team resulted in the discovery and characterization of seven probable  interstellar dust particles [3], four of which were identified from impact craters in the Al foil [4]. At the formal conclusion of the ISPE two years ago, only ~5% of the available Al foil area had been measured. We have continued the work of scanning Al foils from the Stardust interstellar tray in order to identify additional interstellar dust candidates. Here we report the results of our work to date. Experimental: Foil scanning is done in automated mode using the JEOL 840a SEM at Washington University. By combining our instrument control software with custom written software, we are able to automatically map an entire foil in a single (long) run. Foils are divided into multiple grids of about 0.25 mm2. Manual z-axis focusing is done in the center of each region, after which the grids are further divided into individual images 106 x 80 \u00b5m in size. The z-axis positions are interpolated from one grid center to the next to ensure good focus for all individual images in a grid and the x, y, and z coordinates are individually stored. The images are mapped at 15 kV, 5 nA for 10 sec per frame, providing a resolution of ~50 nm/pixel with a dwell time of 0.001 sec/\u00b5m2. The entire array is imaged automatically in sequence, and each image is saved with a unique label identifying its position on the foil.  Images from the foils (~5000 for short foils and ~10,000 for long foils) are manually examined independently by at least two undergraduate students, and the candidate craters identified are subsequently ranked. The most likely candidates are then imaged at higher resolution to ascertain which are actual impact craters. Results: We have scanned a total of four long (N) foils and two short (W) foils: 1010N, 1031N, 1032W, 1047N, 1061N and 1063W. Image examination is still in progress on foil 1010N, but we have identified a feature on this foil that appears to be an unusually large impact crater (Fig. 1). However, additional analysis (e.g., Auger spectroscopy and/or FIB/TEM) will be needed to confirm the identification. A similar feature found on foil 1047N during the ISPE ultimately turned out to be a hole created during the foil flattening process [4].  Figure 1. Secondary electron image 314@43 from interstellar foil 1010N,1. The impact feature is approximately 4 \u00b5m in diameter. Approximately 2700 candidate craters were identified from the other foils, of which 1125 were selected for higher resolution imaging. Table 1 shows the resulting 19 likely impact craters. Eleven of these were investigated as part of the ISPE [4]; the remaining eight are shown in Fig. 2. While some are clear impact craters, others are more ambiguous and, like 314@43 mentioned above, will require additional analysis for confirmation. Outlook:  The number of impact craters identified on individual foils is clearly highly variable and the foils examined by our laboratory as part of the ISPE fortuitously contained a relatively high proportion of craters. Moreover, many of the potential new impact 1005.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)features shown in Fig. 2 are unconventional compared to \u2018traditional craters\u2019 and it remains to be seen whether compositional analyses can confirm an extraterrestrial or even secondary impact origin for these features. Despite these obstacles, the results of the ISPE demonstrate that continued scanning and examination of the Al foils on the interstellar collector has the potential to provide important new information about contemporary interstellar dust.

John D. Arfstrom, jarfstrom@gmail.com, www.JohnArfstrom.com, 904.200.2619. Introduction: Terrestrial anastomosing glacial troughs and streamlined landforms matching the ideal-ly formed channel systems of Mars are lacking. The disparate geology and topography of Earth and Mars may well have variably influenced the erosion of such landforms, which are probably more ideally formed on Mars due to the spatial uniformity and erodibility of the wide expanses of crater scarred, pristine regolith plains. Likewise, the circular ramparts that craters present against the onslaught of erosion, compared to the random forms typical on Earth, would be reflected in the geometries of eroded forms. An important ques-tion to be addressed is: how would ice sheet-generated landscapes on Earth appear if not influenced by pre-existing channeling, topography, and structure of bedrock? Considering the morphology of Kasei Valles, might regolith have supported the generation of its ideally-shaped streamlined landforms akin to the well-formed islands of glacial spillways, yet through the processes of large-scale glacial erosion evidenced by its extant areal scour indicative of wet-based erosion? Discussion: There are examples of terrestrial ice sheet-generated landforms for which landscape consid-erations might explain the above mentioned disparity.  Fig. 1a shows Kasei Valles, an erosional landform net-work comprised of interconnected or anastomosing channels or troughs, supposedly breached and non-breached streamlined landforms, and valley-wide areal scour. Thought to be a flood or glacial spillway chan-nel system, Kasei Valles is here interpreted as a set of glacial troughs and streamlined landforms, likely erod-ed by sub-polar ice sheets [1]. A terrestrial analog can be seen in Fig. 1b. It shows a portion of eastern Ellesmere Island recently exposed by the retreating ice sheet where several streamlined landforms are visible among a network of interconnected glacial troughs. Though the landforms at Kasei Valles are more curvi-linear, whereas more angular at Ellesmere, this could be explained by the uniform and easily eroded regolith, compared to the structured and resistant bedrock. Also, the widespread areal scour at Kasei Valles (Fig. 2), which extends over most streamlined forms, is more consistent with the uniform areal scour typical of ice sheets than the more spatially variable and local-ized erosion typical of the generally more focused ero-sion caused by floods. This is because the pressure melting point within ice sheets (see explanation below) promotes sheet-like erosion, except where geologic and topographic factors promote channelization.  The erosion of the exposed landscape at Ellesmere Island occurred at the base of the nearby ice sheet be-fore it retreated. Although related to intermediate-scale asymmetric and symmetric erosional landforms such as roches mountennees, whalebacks, rock drumlins, and crag and tails, the scale of the landforms are more consistent with \u201clarge-scale selective linear erosion\u201d associated with sub-polar ice sheets, which are cold-based where thinner and warm-based where thick enough [1]. Ice streams within the ice sheet slid across the bedrock with varying velocities, both spatially and temporally, to erode the anastomosing network of troughs. Although inundated by the ice sheet, the streamlined landforms were marked by relatively less basal sliding and erosion than the troughs, having been overlain by thinner, slower moving or stagnant cold-based ice. Similarly, \u201cnon-breached\u201d streamlined land-forms at Kasei Valles may have been inundated by cold-based ice, but were spared the erosion evidenced by the areal scour of adjacent lower topography. The causes of these spatial variations of erosion are better understood if one imagines the pressure melting point, where sliding may occur, as a dynamic, 3-di-mensional layer at depth, controlled by ice thickness   and basal and flow variations [1, 2]. Erosion principal-ly occurs beneath thicker ice where the pressure melt-ing point is met, where warmed by geothermal heat flux, frictional heating, and through heat transfer by water. As erosion continues, enhanced by positive feedback through increasing frictional heating and ice thickness, subglacial troughs lengthen, widen, deepen, and even connect, influenced by parameters such as topography, pre-existing channelling, and faults. Also, as ice flows from a given area, the ice thins and the pressure melting point may drop below the ground surface, causing sliding to cease and flow velocities to decrease in that area. These positive and negative feedback mechanisms cause an ice sheet to maintain a sheet like flow, yet erode troughs where velocities are highest. Anastomosing of troughs result from long-term fluctuations in ice drainage patterns within an ice sheet, represented by linked-flow networks or evolving or switching time-transgressive flow patterns.  In line with these considerations and other morpho-logical interpretations, including those previously pre-sented elsewhere [3, 4, 5], I argue for a sub-polar ice sheet-based interpretation of Kasei Valles, in which variable and widespread erosion induced areal scour and stripped regolith to leave behind its streamlined 1006.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)landform and trough system. This possible glacial ori-gin of Kasei Valles is related globally to other valley systems on Mars in an previous abstract and an associ-ated poster paper, which outlines ongoing research [6].

D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it;.        Introduction: Lunar mare domes are smooth low features with gentle convex upward profiles. In this contribution we provide an analysis of three effusive domes located in the eastern lunar regions near crater Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F, which have previously not been examined in detail. The first examined dome is located at longitude 25.44\u00ba E and latitude 52.24\u00ba N with a base diameter of 6.0 km (Fig. 1). It is a previously unreported dome, which we named Aristoteles 1 (Aris1). Another dome, bisected by Rimae Daniell, located at 24.86\u00b0 E and 38.45\u00b0 N and having a diameter of 9 km, has been termed Plana G1 (P1). It displays three protrusions which probably are pre-existing non-volcanic hills. The third examined dome is situated to the north of P1 and to the east of Plana F, at longitude 39.32\u00b0 E and latitude 13.50\u00b0 N, and has a diameter of 7 km (Fig. 2, dome termed P2).       Spectral properties: For both domes, Clementine  UVVIS spectral data indicate a R415/R750 ratio of about  0.56-0.57 indicating basalts of low TiO2 content and furthermore reveal a 750 nm reflectance of R750 = 0.13 for P1-P2 and 0.16 for Aris1, and a weak mafic absorption for two domes in Lacus Somniorum with R950/R750 = 1.06, suggesting a high soil maturity. The dome Aris1 has a lower R950/R750 ratio of 1.01 (Fig. 3).   Fig. 1. Aristoteles 1 dome marked with arrows.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [5], which depends on the morphometric dome properties, yields estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morphometric values listed in Table 1, we obtained lava viscosities between 8.8 x 104 and 3.0 x 106 Pa s, effusion rates between 60 and 75 m3 s-1, and durations of the effusion process between 0.6 and 2.5 years (Table 2). Furthermore, we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L) according to the model developed in [6]. We found that the magma ascended at speeds between 2.0 x 10- 5 and 6.8 x 10-6 m s-1 through dikes of widths between about 20 and 65 m (Table 2). The dome Aris1 is a typical representative of rheologic group R1 as defined in [1], characterised by lava viscosities of 104-106 Pa s, magma rise speeds U of 10-5-10-3 m s-1, dike widths W around 10-20 m, and dike lengths L between about 30 and 150 km. Rheologic group R2 is characterised by low lava viscosities between 102 and 104 Pa s, fast magma ascent (U > 10-3 m s-1), narrow (W = 1-4 m) and short (L = 7-20 km) feeder dikes. The third group, R3, is made up of domes which formed from highly viscous lavas of 106-108 Pa s, ascending at very low speeds of 10-6-10-5 m s-1 through broad dikes of several tens to 200 m width and 100-200 km length. The domes P1 and P2 are typical representatives of rheologic group R3. Hence, for three examined domes the magma reservoirs are located well below the lunar crust regarding the thicknesses of the total crust of about 55 km [7].     References: [1] W\u00f6hler et al.

Introduction: Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes are some the largest volcanoes on Mars and in our Solar System. Our team is funded by NASA\u2019s Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP) to complete a set of 1:1,000,000 geologic maps of Olympus, Arsia, Pavonis, and Ascraeus based on the mapping style defined by [1,2]. Figure 1 shows the area around each volcano that we are funded to map, including additional sections that cover the rift aprons and small vent fields. Detailed mapping of a limited area of these volcanoes revealed a diverse distribution of volcanic landforms within the calderas, and along the flanks, rift aprons, and surrounding plains [1]. Here, we report on the progress of each map.   Figure 1. MOLA shaded relief map with the bounda-ries (solid lines) for each map and extensions (dashed lines) to cover rift aprons and small vent fields.  Data and Methods: We are mapping each vol-cano in ArcMap 9 and 10.2 to produce digital geo-logic maps at 1:1,000,000 map scale for the USGS. A Context Camera (CTX) mosaic serves as the primary basemap, supplemented by High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), THEMIS daytime IR, HiRISE, and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data. To ad-dress our science questions we have conducted our mapping at ~1:300,000 to ~1:100,000 on the CTX basemap. This scale enables us to distinguish be-tween different morphologic features like sinuous rilles, leveed channels, low shields, and surface tex-tures (hummocky, mottled, smooth), plus we are able to determine flow margins, flow directions, and strat-igraphic relationships between different eruption sequences. Our primary objective for each map is to show the areal extent, distribution, and stratigraphic relationships of the different volcanic morphologies to better understand the changes in effusive style across each volcano and provide insight into the similarities and differences in their evolution. Mapping Progress: Each map is in a different stage of the geologic mapping process. The Ascraeus Mons map is the most recently funded project and we will begin preliminary mapping in 2015. The maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes are also nearing comple-tion and should be ready to submit for publication by mid to late 2015 (Fig. 2). The Olympus Mons map has complete line work and is being prepared for submission to the USGS for publication (Fig. 3). For the Tharsis Montes, our objective this year is to map the contacts between different volcanic provinces on each volcano (e.g., main shield, rift aprons, and lava plains). We have mapped the surficial fan deposits on Pavonis and Arsia Mons using sketch maps from [4-6] as guides for mapping similar units (e.g., smooth, ridged, knobby). See Dapremont et al., this meeting [Abstract #1605] for detailed mapping of the Arsia Mons fan shaped deposit.  Figure 2. Maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes1008.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Discussion:  Our current progress has provided sev-eral insights into the eruption processes and evolu-tion of these volcanoes. Geologic Units: The current mapping units have evolved from the original proposed mapping units to correspond with units used for the recent geologic map of Olympus Mons [6] (Fig. 3).  Detailed image-ry from CTX has allowed us to diversify the units based on various eruption styles. The units are dis-tinguished primarily by morphology and are grouped for each edifice (main shield, rift apron, fan deposit, lava plains). General Formation Sequence: Mapping reveals a similar sequence of events for the evolution of the three Tharsis Montes volcanoes [1,2,8]: 1) main shield forms, 2) eruptions from the NE/SW rifts em-place long lava flows that surround the main flank, 3) eruptions wane and build up the rift aprons and shield fields, 4) glaciers deposit surficial fan deposit material [9], and 5) localized recent eruptions along the main flanks, in the calderas, and within the fan-shaped deposits. Further mapping will reveal the relative geologic timing of eruptive units on the main shields and provide a more complete analysis of the spatial distribution of tube-fed versus channel-fed flows for each volcano and how they compare with Olympus Mons as originally discussed by [1].

Introduction: Lunar sinuous rilles are thought to have formed by thermal erosion, mechanical erosion, construction, or a combination of these processes via emplacement by lava tubes and/or lava channels [1-4]. The investigation of Hadley Rille by Apollo 15 pro-vided the first field observations of a rille, including outcrops of stratigraphic layers within the far rille wall  [5]. High-resolution remote sensing data sets from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter allow for the identification of smaller volcanic features, outcrops, layers, and detailed topographic measurements at the meter-scale [6,7]. Several questions relate to layers observed in the rille walls including: 1) What is their stratigraphic sequence and can individual flows be defined? 2) Are the layers a sequence of multiple, old-er eruptions that have been thermally eroded? 3) Which layers are related to the eruption that formed the rille? Each visible lineation that defines a layer, may not be a surface contact between individual flows, therefore 4) How can individual flows be distinguished within the stratigraphic sequence? and 5) What flow processes can be recognized based on characteristics of the wall rock (inflated pahoehoe) [8]?      Terrestrial volcanic features with similar morphol-ogies to lunar rilles can provide insight into their for-mation on the Moon. While the scale of most lunar rilles are much larger than their terrestrial counterparts, there are several examples similar in scale to ones we have documented in Idaho. The SSERVI FINESSE team (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System Sci-ence and Exploration) [9] conducted field studies at Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (COTM) in Idaho from July 28 \u2013 Aug. 8, 2014 to in-vestigate terrestrial analogs for lunar volcanic and im-pact features [10]. Here, we compare field observa-tions at Inferno Chasm (Figs. 1,2), a rille-like channel in Idaho to Isis (Fig. 3), a similar sized rille on the Moon.  Inferno Chasm (42\u00b058\u201900\u201dN, 113\u00b011\u201925\u201dW) is a basaltic low-shield with a vent and sinuous channel (Fig. 1). The area is overgrown with sage and desert grasses, but it appears that the margins of the low shield have been embayed or buried by subsequent lava flows or loess making it difficult to define the true extent of this volcanic feature and locate lava deposits beyond the end of the channel.   Figure 1. Inferno Chasm in Idaho. (A) Location of Differen-tial GPS and LiDAR surveys [Google Earth]. (B) Morpho-logic sketch map of key flow features and structures.    We documented the geology and morphology of Inferno Chasm using a Riegl Vz-400 LiDAR, a Trim-ble R8 and TopCon Hiper II Differential Global Posi-tioning Systems (DGPS) (Fig. 2), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and sampling. The main vent crater is roughly circular and is ~200 m wide, ~20 m deep and has a small 2.5 m-high mound in the center (Fig. 2). DGPS survey D-D\u2019 shows that the sinuous channel extends to the west while dropping ~10 m over ~1700 m, yielding a slope of -0.005\u00b0 (Fig. 2). Several over-flow channels are also visible in the remote sensing images (Fig. 1B), but are subtle in the field. For exam-ple, DGPS profile C-C\u2019 is 350 m long, 30 m wide, and 2-5 m deep. Outcrops of the vent walls expose massive layers 2-3 m thick with textures that suggest highly welded spatter overlain by a 1-2 m thick sequence of thinner layers (overspills, shelley, gaseous blisters) each 10s of cm thick. Field observations and samples collected indicate low-shield development typical of the Eastern Snake River Plains [11]. 1009.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Lunar Rilles: Isis, a rille in Serenitatis Basin (19\u00b0N, 27.5\u00b0E) (Fig. 3) has a similar morphology to Inferno Chasm. The feature is ~1.3 km wide and ~60-70 m high at the vent. The channel is ~3 km long, 283 m-wide, and 25 m deep [7]. The rille is located within high-Ti basalts and there are no identifiable deposits extending from the end of the channel. The vent is aligned with three other small cones along a north-west-southeast trending graben, possibly related to an intrusive dike. There are boulders present along the rim of the rille, but no distinct layers are visible in the images.  Figure 2. Differential GPS profiles A-A\u2019 across the vent (North to South) and D-D\u2019 along the channel floor (East to West) of Inferno Chasm (see Fig. 1A).  Discussion: Field observations of the wall material at Inferno Chasm suggest the feature was constructed through a combination of thin lava overflow, rheo-morphic flow of congealed spatter, and intense weld-ing of deeper parts, with or without additional lava injection, to form the thick, massive layers. Evidence of thermal erosion and/or lava tube collapse along the channel were not identified, but have not been ruled out. Distinct levees were not identified along the chan-nel margin, but there are linear, topographic highs near the mouth of the channel (Fig. 1B).  Isis has several similarities in both morphology and scale to Inferno Chasm. Both are topographic highs with a central channel ~2-3 km long. No distal depos-its are identified beyond each channel. Isis is atypical compared to larger sinuous rilles, like the example in Marius Hills shown in Fig. 3B. Most lunar rilles ap-pear to carve into the local terrain through thermal erosion [7]. We suggest Isis was formed by construc-tion, from a highly gaseous, fire fountain eruption that created spatter that collected to form the cone and spat-ter-fed flows rather than by thermal erosion. Observa-tions of flow textures in exposed layers and rocks can help interpret the flow processes that formed the rilles [8]. For example, the planar, vesicle horizons observed in rocks along the rim of Hadley Rille are consistent with inflated pahoehoe [8], whereas the tumultuous textures observed in the boulders and wall rock at In-ferno Chasm are consistent with welded spatter. How-ever, given the much larger scale of most lunar rilles, construction may only be a minor component of their formation. Based on the depth of a rille, assumptions on how much the wall represents eroded substrate ma-terial and which layers formed via construction is im-portant for determining parameters for thermal erosion models.

Berkeley, 3British Astronomical Association, 4Jet Propulsion Lab, 5Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.   Introduction:  Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot (GRS) is one of its most distinct and enduring features, having been continuously observed since the 1800\u2019s.  It cur-rently spans the smallest latitude and longitude size ever recorded.  Here we show analyses of 2014 Hubble spectral imaging data to study the color, structure and internal dynamics of this long-live storm. Physical Dimensions: The GRS\u2019s red edges have contracted from a longitude length of ~21\u00b0 during the Voyager flybys in 1979 to ~15.5\u00b0 in Hubble data ac-quired in 2012, shrinking on average 0.19\u00b0/year over the modern era [1]. Amateur observers documented a sudden decrease in longitudinal extent in early 2014, faster than the average rate of contraction, and Hubble Space Telescope time was granted to characterize the current state of the storm.  In the 2014 Hubble data, the red edges of the spot span about 14.1\u00b0 in longitude, a decrease of 1.4\u00b0 (1760 km) in 21 months, a rate of change four times greater than typical since 1979.   The GRS\u2019s latitudinal size has been much more constant, historically spanning between 10.5\u00b0 and 11\u00b0, and is currently 9.4\u00b0, the smallest size measured to date.  There has been a slight overall trend toward lati-tude shrinkage of 0.04\u00b0/year, significantly slower than in the longitude dimension, but the fastest change of 0.7\u00b0 occurred between 2012 and 2014.  Though the storm has a clearly diminishing length-to-width aspect ratio, from 1.8 in the Voyager era (and much greater historically) to 1.5 currently. 1980 1990 2000 2010Date510152025GRS Size (degrees)Visible Length, spacecraftVisible Width, spacecraftVisible Length, groundVisible Width, groundDynamical LengthDynamical Width Figure 1. Measurements of the GRS\u2019s size.  Visible edges, which are somewhat subjective, are often used to mark its size.  Amateur measurements (red) show scatter, but are consistent with spacecraft data. Dynam-ical measures of the narrower high velocity collar also show a trend towards smaller size.   Figure 2. Visual comparison of the GRS\u2019s size in 1995, 2009, and 2014.  Colors have been arbitrarily enhanced for consistency.  Spectral Analysis: Another notable characteristic of the 2014 images is the deep red color of the GRS, which is normally seen only during climatic cycles when the adjacent South Equatorial Belt (SEB) \u201cfades\u201d or whitens, such as during the Pioneer flybys in 1974 [2].  Spectroscopy was performed using Hubble imag-es from 1995 to 2014 to determine the visible color of the darkest core of the storm, Fig. 3.  In this region, the reflectance spectrum (I/F) is fairly constant [3,4].  The greatest change of up to 0.08 in I/F can be seen near 410 nm when comparing data from 1995 and 2008.  The data acquired in 2014, however, show that the spectrum of the GRS is depressed by 0.1 to 0.15 in I/F at all wavelengths shorter than 500 nm.  In addition, reflectance in the 890-nm methane gas absorption band has increased by ~0.11 in I/F since 2009, using the same filter, implying the altitudes and/or the concen-trations of upper tropospheric aerosols have increased [5]. Spectra of other red regions on the planet do not show simultaneous increases in methane-band reflec-1010.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)tivity and visible reddening, ruling out calibration is-sues.  Spectral change is also obvious in the core of the GRS; ratio images indicate that the spectral slope from 630 to 500 nm has steepened in 2014 compared with previous dates over most of the GRS.

Spectral Imaging from Hubble shows dra-matic change in brightness and slope in 2014.  Winds: The internal wind speed of the GRS can top 150 m/s, in a high-velocity collar that is smaller the visual diameter of the storm [1,6,7].  Automated veloc-ity field extraction was attempted from the 2014 data, using the ACCIV method with correlations calculated for box sizes of 5\u00b0 in latitude/longitude, between pairs of velocity field advected images [6].  The quality of the extracted velocity field was insufficient to accu-rately constrain the location and magnitude of the high-speed collar around the vortex due to limitations of the imaging data, e.g., the shadow of Ganymede over the western side of the vortex in the later three frames resulted in only tie point pairs from short 43-min separations over large parts of the GRS rather than 10 hours.  The eastern area of later frames in both or-bits also suffered from reduced contrast due to proxim-ity to Jupiter\u2019s limb.   We identify tangential velocities in the 100\u2013150 m/s range, with higher speeds at the north-south extrema of the vortex, where it interacts with zonal jets, but with larger uncertainties than typi-cal.  Thus, preliminary manual and automated meas-urements of cloud motions showed no significant in-crease in wind speed when compared with winds measured from 1996 to 2006 [1,6,7], implying an in-ternal circulation period of about 3.2 days. Wind Jet Interactions: The sudden shrinkage of the GRS and its observed color change are likely to be in response to changes in jet interactions. The reduc-tion in width is due to shifts of both the northern edge (latitude mean 1979-2012, 16.8\u00b0 S +/-0.3; 2014, 17.4\u00b0 S) and the south edge (latitude mean 1979-2012, 27.4\u00b0 S +/-0.2; 2014, 26.8\u00b0 S).  This causes reduced deflec-tion of the jets north and south of the GRS, altering the zonal wind shear environment sensed by the vortex.  Decreased interaction with small vortices carried by those wind jets may be the reason for the intensified red color in 2014.  In particular, the GRS is now suffi-ciently withdrawn from the westward jet at 19.5\u00b0 S that it does not ingest vortices carried by that jet.  Similar-ly, during SEB fading events there are no vortices be-ing carried by the jet toward the GRS and its color intensifies [2,8].  Conclusions:\t \u00a0 The GRS interacts with the zonal wind jets, with energy or momentum exchange of un-known magnitude. It is not yet understood what colors the clouds and why they can vary in spectral slope and absolute brightness, though the current spectrum may be indicating a change in colored-particle production.  Further analyses of the temperatures, winds, and size of the GRS, especially in epochs of change, will pro-vide interesting constraints to analytic models of geo-strophic balance in the region.  In addition, global cir-culation modeling of the GRS in its flow field for dif-ferent dates will show which configurations are most stable to decay.

In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1. Telescopic image acquired on July 9, 2014, at 03:34 UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian (M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image.       Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0\u00b0, 0.64\u00b0 and 0.54\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

This DEM has been constructed based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.      According to the classification scheme for lunar domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to class E2.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model devel-oped in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the 1001.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 104 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~103 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m-3. The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we esti-mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-3-10-4 m s-1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

Lena1 and Barry Fitz-Gerald2- Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it ; 2 79 South Court Ave, Dorchester, Dorset, DT12DA United Kingdom barryfitz_gerald@hotmail.com       Introduction: To the north-east of the crater Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

V.A. Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

C. Floss1 and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous alteration [1\u20133], and have been found in abundance only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but contains unique features that distinguish it from typical CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is that it appears to have undergone a unique style of highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).   Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix from MIL 07687. In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the secondary alteration it has experienced. Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 33,900 \u00b5m2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively unaltered Fe-poor matrix. Following isotopic identification of the grains, we used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major element compositions of the grains, following standard procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 110 \u00b1 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 \u00b1 19 ppm for SiC, in good agreement with the abundances determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges and medians observed for presolar silicates from primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 [e.g., 1 and references therein]. Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or akagan\u00e9ite [7, 8].  Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from MIL 07687. The results of our imaging survey indicate that presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. However, we do see some differences in the presolar grain abundances between the two types of matrix. Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered ones. However, the difference is not as large as might be expected given that presolar silicates are more susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar grain types. In addition to the difference in abundance, we observe compositional differences in the presolar silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which have a factor of two higher median Fe content than presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.  Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains per 1000 \u00b5m2) in MIL 07687. Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2. This difference is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration. References: [1] Floss and Stadermann (2012) MAPS 47, 992.

C. Floss. Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: In addition to the first unambiguous cometary samples, from comet 81P/Wild 2 [1], NASA\u2019s Stardust mission was designed to collect the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust. The Stardust interstellar dust collector collected particles for 229 days during two exposures prior to the spacecraft encounter with Wild 2 and tracked the interstellar dust stream for all but 34 days of that time. The Al foils make up ~15% of the total collection surface and about 12-15 particles, with 2/3 of those less than ~1 \u00b5m in size, were expected to have impacted the available Al foil area. The initial investigation of these samples took place under the auspices of the CAPTEM-approved Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE). The ISPE proposed to carry out non-destructive, non-invasive searches for, and analyses of, interstellar dust candidates in the Stardust interstellar tray and focused on two parallel investigations: extraction and analysis of tracks in aerogel identified through Stardust@home, and search for and characterization of impact craters in the aluminum foils [2].  The work of the ISPE team resulted in the discovery and characterization of seven probable  interstellar dust particles [3], four of which were identified from impact craters in the Al foil [4]. At the formal conclusion of the ISPE two years ago, only ~5% of the available Al foil area had been measured. We have continued the work of scanning Al foils from the Stardust interstellar tray in order to identify additional interstellar dust candidates. Here we report the results of our work to date. Experimental: Foil scanning is done in automated mode using the JEOL 840a SEM at Washington University. By combining our instrument control software with custom written software, we are able to automatically map an entire foil in a single (long) run. Foils are divided into multiple grids of about 0.25 mm2. Manual z-axis focusing is done in the center of each region, after which the grids are further divided into individual images 106 x 80 \u00b5m in size. The z-axis positions are interpolated from one grid center to the next to ensure good focus for all individual images in a grid and the x, y, and z coordinates are individually stored. The images are mapped at 15 kV, 5 nA for 10 sec per frame, providing a resolution of ~50 nm/pixel with a dwell time of 0.001 sec/\u00b5m2. The entire array is imaged automatically in sequence, and each image is saved with a unique label identifying its position on the foil.  Images from the foils (~5000 for short foils and ~10,000 for long foils) are manually examined independently by at least two undergraduate students, and the candidate craters identified are subsequently ranked. The most likely candidates are then imaged at higher resolution to ascertain which are actual impact craters. Results: We have scanned a total of four long (N) foils and two short (W) foils: 1010N, 1031N, 1032W, 1047N, 1061N and 1063W. Image examination is still in progress on foil 1010N, but we have identified a feature on this foil that appears to be an unusually large impact crater (Fig. 1). However, additional analysis (e.g., Auger spectroscopy and/or FIB/TEM) will be needed to confirm the identification. A similar feature found on foil 1047N during the ISPE ultimately turned out to be a hole created during the foil flattening process [4].  Figure 1. Secondary electron image 314@43 from interstellar foil 1010N,1. The impact feature is approximately 4 \u00b5m in diameter. Approximately 2700 candidate craters were identified from the other foils, of which 1125 were selected for higher resolution imaging. Table 1 shows the resulting 19 likely impact craters. Eleven of these were investigated as part of the ISPE [4]; the remaining eight are shown in Fig. 2. While some are clear impact craters, others are more ambiguous and, like 314@43 mentioned above, will require additional analysis for confirmation. Outlook:  The number of impact craters identified on individual foils is clearly highly variable and the foils examined by our laboratory as part of the ISPE fortuitously contained a relatively high proportion of craters. Moreover, many of the potential new impact 1005.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)features shown in Fig. 2 are unconventional compared to \u2018traditional craters\u2019 and it remains to be seen whether compositional analyses can confirm an extraterrestrial or even secondary impact origin for these features. Despite these obstacles, the results of the ISPE demonstrate that continued scanning and examination of the Al foils on the interstellar collector has the potential to provide important new information about contemporary interstellar dust.

John D. Arfstrom, jarfstrom@gmail.com, www.JohnArfstrom.com, 904.200.2619. Introduction: Terrestrial anastomosing glacial troughs and streamlined landforms matching the ideal-ly formed channel systems of Mars are lacking. The disparate geology and topography of Earth and Mars may well have variably influenced the erosion of such landforms, which are probably more ideally formed on Mars due to the spatial uniformity and erodibility of the wide expanses of crater scarred, pristine regolith plains. Likewise, the circular ramparts that craters present against the onslaught of erosion, compared to the random forms typical on Earth, would be reflected in the geometries of eroded forms. An important ques-tion to be addressed is: how would ice sheet-generated landscapes on Earth appear if not influenced by pre-existing channeling, topography, and structure of bedrock? Considering the morphology of Kasei Valles, might regolith have supported the generation of its ideally-shaped streamlined landforms akin to the well-formed islands of glacial spillways, yet through the processes of large-scale glacial erosion evidenced by its extant areal scour indicative of wet-based erosion? Discussion: There are examples of terrestrial ice sheet-generated landforms for which landscape consid-erations might explain the above mentioned disparity.  Fig. 1a shows Kasei Valles, an erosional landform net-work comprised of interconnected or anastomosing channels or troughs, supposedly breached and non-breached streamlined landforms, and valley-wide areal scour. Thought to be a flood or glacial spillway chan-nel system, Kasei Valles is here interpreted as a set of glacial troughs and streamlined landforms, likely erod-ed by sub-polar ice sheets [1]. A terrestrial analog can be seen in Fig. 1b. It shows a portion of eastern Ellesmere Island recently exposed by the retreating ice sheet where several streamlined landforms are visible among a network of interconnected glacial troughs. Though the landforms at Kasei Valles are more curvi-linear, whereas more angular at Ellesmere, this could be explained by the uniform and easily eroded regolith, compared to the structured and resistant bedrock. Also, the widespread areal scour at Kasei Valles (Fig. 2), which extends over most streamlined forms, is more consistent with the uniform areal scour typical of ice sheets than the more spatially variable and local-ized erosion typical of the generally more focused ero-sion caused by floods. This is because the pressure melting point within ice sheets (see explanation below) promotes sheet-like erosion, except where geologic and topographic factors promote channelization.  The erosion of the exposed landscape at Ellesmere Island occurred at the base of the nearby ice sheet be-fore it retreated. Although related to intermediate-scale asymmetric and symmetric erosional landforms such as roches mountennees, whalebacks, rock drumlins, and crag and tails, the scale of the landforms are more consistent with \u201clarge-scale selective linear erosion\u201d associated with sub-polar ice sheets, which are cold-based where thinner and warm-based where thick enough [1]. Ice streams within the ice sheet slid across the bedrock with varying velocities, both spatially and temporally, to erode the anastomosing network of troughs. Although inundated by the ice sheet, the streamlined landforms were marked by relatively less basal sliding and erosion than the troughs, having been overlain by thinner, slower moving or stagnant cold-based ice. Similarly, \u201cnon-breached\u201d streamlined land-forms at Kasei Valles may have been inundated by cold-based ice, but were spared the erosion evidenced by the areal scour of adjacent lower topography. The causes of these spatial variations of erosion are better understood if one imagines the pressure melting point, where sliding may occur, as a dynamic, 3-di-mensional layer at depth, controlled by ice thickness   and basal and flow variations [1, 2]. Erosion principal-ly occurs beneath thicker ice where the pressure melt-ing point is met, where warmed by geothermal heat flux, frictional heating, and through heat transfer by water. As erosion continues, enhanced by positive feedback through increasing frictional heating and ice thickness, subglacial troughs lengthen, widen, deepen, and even connect, influenced by parameters such as topography, pre-existing channelling, and faults. Also, as ice flows from a given area, the ice thins and the pressure melting point may drop below the ground surface, causing sliding to cease and flow velocities to decrease in that area. These positive and negative feedback mechanisms cause an ice sheet to maintain a sheet like flow, yet erode troughs where velocities are highest. Anastomosing of troughs result from long-term fluctuations in ice drainage patterns within an ice sheet, represented by linked-flow networks or evolving or switching time-transgressive flow patterns.  In line with these considerations and other morpho-logical interpretations, including those previously pre-sented elsewhere [3, 4, 5], I argue for a sub-polar ice sheet-based interpretation of Kasei Valles, in which variable and widespread erosion induced areal scour and stripped regolith to leave behind its streamlined 1006.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)landform and trough system. This possible glacial ori-gin of Kasei Valles is related globally to other valley systems on Mars in an previous abstract and an associ-ated poster paper, which outlines ongoing research [6].

P. Lazzarotti.1 and R. Lena2 - Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Pernice 71, 54100 Massa, Italy; paolo@lazzarotti-hires.com; 2Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it;.        Introduction: Lunar mare domes are smooth low features with gentle convex upward profiles. In this contribution we provide an analysis of three effusive domes located in the eastern lunar regions near crater Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F, which have previously not been examined in detail. The first examined dome is located at longitude 25.44\u00ba E and latitude 52.24\u00ba N with a base diameter of 6.0 km (Fig. 1). It is a previously unreported dome, which we named Aristoteles 1 (Aris1). Another dome, bisected by Rimae Daniell, located at 24.86\u00b0 E and 38.45\u00b0 N and having a diameter of 9 km, has been termed Plana G1 (P1). It displays three protrusions which probably are pre-existing non-volcanic hills. The third examined dome is situated to the north of P1 and to the east of Plana F, at longitude 39.32\u00b0 E and latitude 13.50\u00b0 N, and has a diameter of 7 km (Fig. 2, dome termed P2).       Spectral properties: For both domes, Clementine  UVVIS spectral data indicate a R415/R750 ratio of about  0.56-0.57 indicating basalts of low TiO2 content and furthermore reveal a 750 nm reflectance of R750 = 0.13 for P1-P2 and 0.16 for Aris1, and a weak mafic absorption for two domes in Lacus Somniorum with R950/R750 = 1.06, suggesting a high soil maturity. The dome Aris1 has a lower R950/R750 ratio of 1.01 (Fig. 3).   Fig. 1. Aristoteles 1 dome marked with arrows.

The flank slopes, diameters, heights, and edifice volumes of these domes were extracted from the DEMs (Table 1). The dome Aris1 belongs to class B2, while the domes P1 and P2 are of subclass C2, as introduced in [1, 3].

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [5], which depends on the morphometric dome properties, yields estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morphometric values listed in Table 1, we obtained lava viscosities between 8.8 x 104 and 3.0 x 106 Pa s, effusion rates between 60 and 75 m3 s-1, and durations of the effusion process between 0.6 and 2.5 years (Table 2). Furthermore, we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L) according to the model developed in [6]. We found that the magma ascended at speeds between 2.0 x 10- 5 and 6.8 x 10-6 m s-1 through dikes of widths between about 20 and 65 m (Table 2). The dome Aris1 is a typical representative of rheologic group R1 as defined in [1], characterised by lava viscosities of 104-106 Pa s, magma rise speeds U of 10-5-10-3 m s-1, dike widths W around 10-20 m, and dike lengths L between about 30 and 150 km. Rheologic group R2 is characterised by low lava viscosities between 102 and 104 Pa s, fast magma ascent (U > 10-3 m s-1), narrow (W = 1-4 m) and short (L = 7-20 km) feeder dikes. The third group, R3, is made up of domes which formed from highly viscous lavas of 106-108 Pa s, ascending at very low speeds of 10-6-10-5 m s-1 through broad dikes of several tens to 200 m width and 100-200 km length. The domes P1 and P2 are typical representatives of rheologic group R3. Hence, for three examined domes the magma reservoirs are located well below the lunar crust regarding the thicknesses of the total crust of about 55 km [7].     References: [1] W\u00f6hler et al.

Introduction: Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes are some the largest volcanoes on Mars and in our Solar System. Our team is funded by NASA\u2019s Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP) to complete a set of 1:1,000,000 geologic maps of Olympus, Arsia, Pavonis, and Ascraeus based on the mapping style defined by [1,2]. Figure 1 shows the area around each volcano that we are funded to map, including additional sections that cover the rift aprons and small vent fields. Detailed mapping of a limited area of these volcanoes revealed a diverse distribution of volcanic landforms within the calderas, and along the flanks, rift aprons, and surrounding plains [1]. Here, we report on the progress of each map.   Figure 1. MOLA shaded relief map with the bounda-ries (solid lines) for each map and extensions (dashed lines) to cover rift aprons and small vent fields.  Data and Methods: We are mapping each vol-cano in ArcMap 9 and 10.2 to produce digital geo-logic maps at 1:1,000,000 map scale for the USGS. A Context Camera (CTX) mosaic serves as the primary basemap, supplemented by High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), THEMIS daytime IR, HiRISE, and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data. To ad-dress our science questions we have conducted our mapping at ~1:300,000 to ~1:100,000 on the CTX basemap. This scale enables us to distinguish be-tween different morphologic features like sinuous rilles, leveed channels, low shields, and surface tex-tures (hummocky, mottled, smooth), plus we are able to determine flow margins, flow directions, and strat-igraphic relationships between different eruption sequences. Our primary objective for each map is to show the areal extent, distribution, and stratigraphic relationships of the different volcanic morphologies to better understand the changes in effusive style across each volcano and provide insight into the similarities and differences in their evolution. Mapping Progress: Each map is in a different stage of the geologic mapping process. The Ascraeus Mons map is the most recently funded project and we will begin preliminary mapping in 2015. The maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes are also nearing comple-tion and should be ready to submit for publication by mid to late 2015 (Fig. 2). The Olympus Mons map has complete line work and is being prepared for submission to the USGS for publication (Fig. 3). For the Tharsis Montes, our objective this year is to map the contacts between different volcanic provinces on each volcano (e.g., main shield, rift aprons, and lava plains). We have mapped the surficial fan deposits on Pavonis and Arsia Mons using sketch maps from [4-6] as guides for mapping similar units (e.g., smooth, ridged, knobby). See Dapremont et al., this meeting [Abstract #1605] for detailed mapping of the Arsia Mons fan shaped deposit.  Figure 2. Maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes1008.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Discussion:  Our current progress has provided sev-eral insights into the eruption processes and evolu-tion of these volcanoes. Geologic Units: The current mapping units have evolved from the original proposed mapping units to correspond with units used for the recent geologic map of Olympus Mons [6] (Fig. 3).  Detailed image-ry from CTX has allowed us to diversify the units based on various eruption styles. The units are dis-tinguished primarily by morphology and are grouped for each edifice (main shield, rift apron, fan deposit, lava plains). General Formation Sequence: Mapping reveals a similar sequence of events for the evolution of the three Tharsis Montes volcanoes [1,2,8]: 1) main shield forms, 2) eruptions from the NE/SW rifts em-place long lava flows that surround the main flank, 3) eruptions wane and build up the rift aprons and shield fields, 4) glaciers deposit surficial fan deposit material [9], and 5) localized recent eruptions along the main flanks, in the calderas, and within the fan-shaped deposits. Further mapping will reveal the relative geologic timing of eruptive units on the main shields and provide a more complete analysis of the spatial distribution of tube-fed versus channel-fed flows for each volcano and how they compare with Olympus Mons as originally discussed by [1].

Introduction: Lunar sinuous rilles are thought to have formed by thermal erosion, mechanical erosion, construction, or a combination of these processes via emplacement by lava tubes and/or lava channels [1-4]. The investigation of Hadley Rille by Apollo 15 pro-vided the first field observations of a rille, including outcrops of stratigraphic layers within the far rille wall  [5]. High-resolution remote sensing data sets from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter allow for the identification of smaller volcanic features, outcrops, layers, and detailed topographic measurements at the meter-scale [6,7]. Several questions relate to layers observed in the rille walls including: 1) What is their stratigraphic sequence and can individual flows be defined? 2) Are the layers a sequence of multiple, old-er eruptions that have been thermally eroded? 3) Which layers are related to the eruption that formed the rille? Each visible lineation that defines a layer, may not be a surface contact between individual flows, therefore 4) How can individual flows be distinguished within the stratigraphic sequence? and 5) What flow processes can be recognized based on characteristics of the wall rock (inflated pahoehoe) [8]?      Terrestrial volcanic features with similar morphol-ogies to lunar rilles can provide insight into their for-mation on the Moon. While the scale of most lunar rilles are much larger than their terrestrial counterparts, there are several examples similar in scale to ones we have documented in Idaho. The SSERVI FINESSE team (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System Sci-ence and Exploration) [9] conducted field studies at Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (COTM) in Idaho from July 28 \u2013 Aug. 8, 2014 to in-vestigate terrestrial analogs for lunar volcanic and im-pact features [10]. Here, we compare field observa-tions at Inferno Chasm (Figs. 1,2), a rille-like channel in Idaho to Isis (Fig. 3), a similar sized rille on the Moon.  Inferno Chasm (42\u00b058\u201900\u201dN, 113\u00b011\u201925\u201dW) is a basaltic low-shield with a vent and sinuous channel (Fig. 1). The area is overgrown with sage and desert grasses, but it appears that the margins of the low shield have been embayed or buried by subsequent lava flows or loess making it difficult to define the true extent of this volcanic feature and locate lava deposits beyond the end of the channel.   Figure 1. Inferno Chasm in Idaho. (A) Location of Differen-tial GPS and LiDAR surveys [Google Earth]. (B) Morpho-logic sketch map of key flow features and structures.    We documented the geology and morphology of Inferno Chasm using a Riegl Vz-400 LiDAR, a Trim-ble R8 and TopCon Hiper II Differential Global Posi-tioning Systems (DGPS) (Fig. 2), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and sampling. The main vent crater is roughly circular and is ~200 m wide, ~20 m deep and has a small 2.5 m-high mound in the center (Fig. 2). DGPS survey D-D\u2019 shows that the sinuous channel extends to the west while dropping ~10 m over ~1700 m, yielding a slope of -0.005\u00b0 (Fig. 2). Several over-flow channels are also visible in the remote sensing images (Fig. 1B), but are subtle in the field. For exam-ple, DGPS profile C-C\u2019 is 350 m long, 30 m wide, and 2-5 m deep. Outcrops of the vent walls expose massive layers 2-3 m thick with textures that suggest highly welded spatter overlain by a 1-2 m thick sequence of thinner layers (overspills, shelley, gaseous blisters) each 10s of cm thick. Field observations and samples collected indicate low-shield development typical of the Eastern Snake River Plains [11]. 1009.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Lunar Rilles: Isis, a rille in Serenitatis Basin (19\u00b0N, 27.5\u00b0E) (Fig. 3) has a similar morphology to Inferno Chasm. The feature is ~1.3 km wide and ~60-70 m high at the vent. The channel is ~3 km long, 283 m-wide, and 25 m deep [7]. The rille is located within high-Ti basalts and there are no identifiable deposits extending from the end of the channel. The vent is aligned with three other small cones along a north-west-southeast trending graben, possibly related to an intrusive dike. There are boulders present along the rim of the rille, but no distinct layers are visible in the images.  Figure 2. Differential GPS profiles A-A\u2019 across the vent (North to South) and D-D\u2019 along the channel floor (East to West) of Inferno Chasm (see Fig. 1A).  Discussion: Field observations of the wall material at Inferno Chasm suggest the feature was constructed through a combination of thin lava overflow, rheo-morphic flow of congealed spatter, and intense weld-ing of deeper parts, with or without additional lava injection, to form the thick, massive layers. Evidence of thermal erosion and/or lava tube collapse along the channel were not identified, but have not been ruled out. Distinct levees were not identified along the chan-nel margin, but there are linear, topographic highs near the mouth of the channel (Fig. 1B).  Isis has several similarities in both morphology and scale to Inferno Chasm. Both are topographic highs with a central channel ~2-3 km long. No distal depos-its are identified beyond each channel. Isis is atypical compared to larger sinuous rilles, like the example in Marius Hills shown in Fig. 3B. Most lunar rilles ap-pear to carve into the local terrain through thermal erosion [7]. We suggest Isis was formed by construc-tion, from a highly gaseous, fire fountain eruption that created spatter that collected to form the cone and spat-ter-fed flows rather than by thermal erosion. Observa-tions of flow textures in exposed layers and rocks can help interpret the flow processes that formed the rilles [8]. For example, the planar, vesicle horizons observed in rocks along the rim of Hadley Rille are consistent with inflated pahoehoe [8], whereas the tumultuous textures observed in the boulders and wall rock at In-ferno Chasm are consistent with welded spatter. How-ever, given the much larger scale of most lunar rilles, construction may only be a minor component of their formation. Based on the depth of a rille, assumptions on how much the wall represents eroded substrate ma-terial and which layers formed via construction is im-portant for determining parameters for thermal erosion models.

Berkeley, 3British Astronomical Association, 4Jet Propulsion Lab, 5Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.   Introduction:  Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot (GRS) is one of its most distinct and enduring features, having been continuously observed since the 1800\u2019s.  It cur-rently spans the smallest latitude and longitude size ever recorded.  Here we show analyses of 2014 Hubble spectral imaging data to study the color, structure and internal dynamics of this long-live storm. Physical Dimensions: The GRS\u2019s red edges have contracted from a longitude length of ~21\u00b0 during the Voyager flybys in 1979 to ~15.5\u00b0 in Hubble data ac-quired in 2012, shrinking on average 0.19\u00b0/year over the modern era [1]. Amateur observers documented a sudden decrease in longitudinal extent in early 2014, faster than the average rate of contraction, and Hubble Space Telescope time was granted to characterize the current state of the storm.  In the 2014 Hubble data, the red edges of the spot span about 14.1\u00b0 in longitude, a decrease of 1.4\u00b0 (1760 km) in 21 months, a rate of change four times greater than typical since 1979.   The GRS\u2019s latitudinal size has been much more constant, historically spanning between 10.5\u00b0 and 11\u00b0, and is currently 9.4\u00b0, the smallest size measured to date.  There has been a slight overall trend toward lati-tude shrinkage of 0.04\u00b0/year, significantly slower than in the longitude dimension, but the fastest change of 0.7\u00b0 occurred between 2012 and 2014.  Though the storm has a clearly diminishing length-to-width aspect ratio, from 1.8 in the Voyager era (and much greater historically) to 1.5 currently. 1980 1990 2000 2010Date510152025GRS Size (degrees)Visible Length, spacecraftVisible Width, spacecraftVisible Length, groundVisible Width, groundDynamical LengthDynamical Width Figure 1. Measurements of the GRS\u2019s size.  Visible edges, which are somewhat subjective, are often used to mark its size.  Amateur measurements (red) show scatter, but are consistent with spacecraft data. Dynam-ical measures of the narrower high velocity collar also show a trend towards smaller size.   Figure 2. Visual comparison of the GRS\u2019s size in 1995, 2009, and 2014.  Colors have been arbitrarily enhanced for consistency.  Spectral Analysis: Another notable characteristic of the 2014 images is the deep red color of the GRS, which is normally seen only during climatic cycles when the adjacent South Equatorial Belt (SEB) \u201cfades\u201d or whitens, such as during the Pioneer flybys in 1974 [2].  Spectroscopy was performed using Hubble imag-es from 1995 to 2014 to determine the visible color of the darkest core of the storm, Fig. 3.  In this region, the reflectance spectrum (I/F) is fairly constant [3,4].  The greatest change of up to 0.08 in I/F can be seen near 410 nm when comparing data from 1995 and 2008.  The data acquired in 2014, however, show that the spectrum of the GRS is depressed by 0.1 to 0.15 in I/F at all wavelengths shorter than 500 nm.  In addition, reflectance in the 890-nm methane gas absorption band has increased by ~0.11 in I/F since 2009, using the same filter, implying the altitudes and/or the concen-trations of upper tropospheric aerosols have increased [5]. Spectra of other red regions on the planet do not show simultaneous increases in methane-band reflec-1010.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)tivity and visible reddening, ruling out calibration is-sues.  Spectral change is also obvious in the core of the GRS; ratio images indicate that the spectral slope from 630 to 500 nm has steepened in 2014 compared with previous dates over most of the GRS.

Spectral Imaging from Hubble shows dra-matic change in brightness and slope in 2014.  Winds: The internal wind speed of the GRS can top 150 m/s, in a high-velocity collar that is smaller the visual diameter of the storm [1,6,7].  Automated veloc-ity field extraction was attempted from the 2014 data, using the ACCIV method with correlations calculated for box sizes of 5\u00b0 in latitude/longitude, between pairs of velocity field advected images [6].  The quality of the extracted velocity field was insufficient to accu-rately constrain the location and magnitude of the high-speed collar around the vortex due to limitations of the imaging data, e.g., the shadow of Ganymede over the western side of the vortex in the later three frames resulted in only tie point pairs from short 43-min separations over large parts of the GRS rather than 10 hours.  The eastern area of later frames in both or-bits also suffered from reduced contrast due to proxim-ity to Jupiter\u2019s limb.   We identify tangential velocities in the 100\u2013150 m/s range, with higher speeds at the north-south extrema of the vortex, where it interacts with zonal jets, but with larger uncertainties than typi-cal.  Thus, preliminary manual and automated meas-urements of cloud motions showed no significant in-crease in wind speed when compared with winds measured from 1996 to 2006 [1,6,7], implying an in-ternal circulation period of about 3.2 days. Wind Jet Interactions: The sudden shrinkage of the GRS and its observed color change are likely to be in response to changes in jet interactions. The reduc-tion in width is due to shifts of both the northern edge (latitude mean 1979-2012, 16.8\u00b0 S +/-0.3; 2014, 17.4\u00b0 S) and the south edge (latitude mean 1979-2012, 27.4\u00b0 S +/-0.2; 2014, 26.8\u00b0 S).  This causes reduced deflec-tion of the jets north and south of the GRS, altering the zonal wind shear environment sensed by the vortex.  Decreased interaction with small vortices carried by those wind jets may be the reason for the intensified red color in 2014.  In particular, the GRS is now suffi-ciently withdrawn from the westward jet at 19.5\u00b0 S that it does not ingest vortices carried by that jet.  Similar-ly, during SEB fading events there are no vortices be-ing carried by the jet toward the GRS and its color intensifies [2,8].  Conclusions:\t \u00a0 The GRS interacts with the zonal wind jets, with energy or momentum exchange of un-known magnitude. It is not yet understood what colors the clouds and why they can vary in spectral slope and absolute brightness, though the current spectrum may be indicating a change in colored-particle production.  Further analyses of the temperatures, winds, and size of the GRS, especially in epochs of change, will pro-vide interesting constraints to analytic models of geo-strophic balance in the region.  In addition, global cir-culation modeling of the GRS in its flow field for dif-ferent dates will show which configurations are most stable to decay.

R. E. Jacobsen1 and D. M. Burr1, 1University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA 37996 (RJacobse@vols.utk.edu and dburr1@utk.edu).  Background:  The geomorphology of precipita-tion-fed fluvial activity suggests a transition from wetter conditions to drier conditions in martian history [1 & refs. therein]. The Aeolis Dorsa (AD) region, located between Aeolis and Zephyria Plana and south of the Cerberus lavas [2], contains numerous sinuous ridges and fans interpreted to be inverted fluvial deposits [e.g., 3-8]. These deposits, when arranged stratigraphically, are a microcosm of martian fluvial history [cf. 7]. In addition to a rich fluvial history, the region has experienced burial by volcanic ash and/or aeolian deposits of the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF), exhumation through aeolian abrasion, forming yardangs [9 & refs. therein], and topographic modification by collapse or tectonic processes [5]. The most common inverted fluvial features are flat-topped sinuous ridges and ridge networks [3]. Some ridges have semi-concentric lineations similar to terrestrial meander deposits, which on Earth, generally require more steady hydrologic conditions [10]. These deposits have been interpreted as scroll-bars [3] or laterally aggrading channel beds of meandering rivers [8]. Inverted fluvial features imply some inurdation [4 & refs. therein], likely by geochemical cementation, followed by erosion of host MFF [4]. Thin sinuous ridges, some of which appear stacked above flat-topped inverted fluvial features, have been interpreted as inverted paleochannels from a second episode of fluvial activity [3,4,6]. The fan-shaped features connect to inverted paleochannels or paleochannel networks, and have been interpreted as alluvial fans [3,7], which on Earth have intermittent flows and \u201cflashy\u201d discharges [11]. Hypothesis:  Previous analyses [e.g., 3-8] suggest the following sequence of events for the formation of AD. (a) Long-duration, meandering rivers deposited sediments within valleys at least a few kilometers wide. (b) MFF deposits infilled these river valleys. (c) Sinuous but narrower rivers exploited some of the same river valleys, depositing sediment within these (stratigraphically higher) channels. (d) Fluvial sedi-ments from both (a) and (c) were indurated. (e) River valley walls (MFF) were eroded, resulting in topo-graphic inversion of (a) and (c). (f) Relief developed along the interior margins of Aeolis and Zephyria Pla-na. (g) Alluvial fans formed along interior margins. (h) Fans became indurated. (i) MFF deposits covered the region. (j) Exhumation and erosion inverted the (indu-rated) fans and revealed the (previously inverted) flu-vial features of (a) and (c). (k) Local to sub-regional deformation (e.g., by collapse or tectonism) occurred. The transition from wetter to drier conditions are in-ferred from the deposits of events (a), (c), and (g). Methods:  To test the geographical extent of this hypothesis, stratigraphies were made and compared among geospatially distributed locations, Area 45N and Area 40 (Figure 1). Hypothesis testing required images from the Context Camera (CTX) [12], High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) [13], and topography from CTX digital terrian models, derived from Ames Stereo Pipeline [14]. Boundaries for geomorphological units were delinated in ArcMap software. Interpretations of inverted fluvial features, lava units, and yardangs were based on previous inter-pretations described in the background [2-9].  Figure 1: Black boxes mark locations for geomorphological and stratal observations presented here, and previously [6]. Results: Area 45N:  Flat-topped ridges, consistent with broad deposits of inverted fluvial channels or flu-vial valleys [3,4], are hosted within the lowest unit (fd) (Figure 2). A superposed thin ridge, interpreted as an inverted fluvial channel, points to later deposition of a subsequent fluvial unit (fct). This stacked assemblage indicates two episodes of fluvial activity. NW-SE-oriented yardangs cross-cut thin inverted channels (unit fct), cover inverted fluvial deposits (unit fd) and intra-ridge areas, indicating that units fct and fd were inverted, covered by MFF, and later eroded by aeolian abrasion. An alluvial fan grades into NW-SE yardangs that superpose unit fd, indicating that the fan formed in a unit (af) deposited with or after deposition of MFF. 1011.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Area 40:  Flat ridges with interior, semi-concentric curved ridges, consistent with inverted fluvial meander deposits [3,4,8], are hosted within unit fm (Figure 3). Narrower flat ridges, consistent with flat-topped in-verted fluvial channels [3,4], are hosted within unit fcf. Unit fm cross-cuts unit fcf, indicating that unit fcf is older than unit fm. A unit of thin inverted fluvial chan-nels (fct) superposes unit fm, indicating a third period of fluvial activity and subsequent inversion. A mound-forming unit (mu) has many small craters, and troughs that terminate at a unit of fans (af), indicating a fourth period of fluvial activity. Discussion:  The formation of Area 45N is similar to the hypothesis. Deviations from the hypothesis oc-cur in events (a), because evidence for meandering (i.e., semi-concentric lineations) is lacking, and event (k), since no evidence of deformation is observed [5]. The stratigraphic history in Area 40 differs from the hypothesis. Older paleochannels of unit fcf indicate that, depending on location, event (a) may consist of one or more stratal units (i.e., members). Troughs in unit mu that lead to fans (af) also differ from the hy-pothesis. In Area 40, relief was created along unit mu, followed by precipitation, run-off, sediment transport, and deposition. In many other areas of AD, including Area 45N, the host unit for the fans (unit mu) has been eroded, leaving inverted paleochannels and fans. Conclusions:  The transition from wetter to drier hydrological conditions is preserved in the stratigraphy of Aeolis Dorsa, beginning with fluvial deposits of greater hydrologic stability (e.g., meander deposits in Area 40 and integrated fluvial channels or valleys in 45N) and ending with hydrologically intermittent allu-vial fans in both areas.  Measurements of paleochannel morphology by area and stratal unit will be coupled with scaled form-discharge relationships [4,7,15 & refs. therein] to esti-mate paleodischarge through time.

In this contribution we provide an analysis of three low domes located to the north of Aristarchus region near crater Wollaston, termed W1-3 (Fig.1 and Table 1). The lavas of the examined mare domes are characterized by low R415/R750 (reddish lavas) indicat-ing a low TiO2 content (Table 3).  Fig. 1. Telescopic image acquired on July 9, 2014, at 03:34 UT with a 450 mm aperture Starmaster driven Dobsonian (M. Wirths). Rectified view of the telescopic CCD image.       Morphometric dome properties: Based on the telescopic CCD image (Fig. 1) we obtained a DEM of the examined domes by applying the combined photoclinometry and shape from shading method (sfs) described in [1-3]. The heights of the domes W1-3 were determined to 53, 55 and 40 m, resulting in flank slopes of 1.0\u00b0, 0.64\u00b0 and 0.54\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 2 and 3). Assuming a parabolic shape the estimated edifice volumes correspond to about 1.1, 3.2 and 1.2 km3 for three examined domes W1-W3. We also estimated the height of W1 based on shadow length measurements in the oblique illumination view shown in Fig. 1, where a value of 50 m was computed according to lunar topo-graphic orthophotomap LTO 39A1.

GLD100 dataset: Scholten et al. present a nearly global lunar DEM with a grid size of 100 m, the so-called GLD100 [4]. This DEM has been constructed based on photogrammetric analysis of LROC WAC image pairs. ACT-REACT Quick Map tool was used to access to the GLD100 dataset, allowing to obtain the cross-sectional profiles and the corresponding 3D view (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained with photoclinometry and sfs applied to telescopic image.      According to the classification scheme for lunar domes introduced in [1, 3], and based on a principal component analysis (PCA), the domes W2 and W3 belong to class C1. On the contrary, W1 belongs to class E2.

Cross-sectional profile in east-west direction derived from the telescopic image for the domes W1(top), W2 (mid-dle) and W3 (bottom). The vertical axis is 10 times exagger-ated.      Rheologic properties: The rheologic model devel-oped in [5], which relies on the morphometric dome properties, yelds estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the 1001.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion pro-cess for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morpho-metric values listed in Table 1, we obtained rheologic properties for the examined domes (Table 2).     The dome W1 is characterised by a moderate lava viscosity of 104 Pa s, while for W2 and W3 we have inferred lava viscosities of ~103 Pa s computed based on a lava density of 2800 kg m-3. The domes formed over a period of time of about 0.3 years (W1 and W2) and 0.16 years (W3).  According to the model developed in [6], we esti-mated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L). For three domes we found magma rise speeds of the order 10-3-10-4 m s-1 and dike lengths of 16-32 km. The inferred dike widths amount to 9 m, 4 m and 3.5 m for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. With its rheologic properties and dike dimension, W1 is a typical representative of the rheologic group R1 intro-duced in [1, 3], while the domes W2 and W3 belongs to group R2 due to their lower lava viscosity.

Lena1 and Barry Fitz-Gerald2- Geologic Lunar Research (GLR) Group. 1Via Cartesio 144, sc. D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it ; 2 79 South Court Ave, Dorchester, Dorset, DT12DA United Kingdom barryfitz_gerald@hotmail.com       Introduction: To the north-east of the crater Schroter and north of Mosting E is an oval area of mare approximately 70 km on an east-west axis and 100 along a north-south axis. This was mapped as be-ing mostly Procellarum Group mare material overlain in places by darker pyroclastic materials and is bound-ed to the west by a more rugged terrain mapped as be-longing to the Caley Formation [1]. This area appears to be related to the eastern Sinus Aestuum II Dark Mantle Deposit (DMD), reported in [2]. This feature is however smoother less rugged surface sets it apart from this more extensive Sinus Aestuum II DMD. In this contribution we describe a large volcanic dome and associated lunar pyroclastic deposits located at 3.43\u00b0 N and 5.10\u00b0 W (Figs. 1a-1b). Morphometric properties: The dome, termed Sc1, has a base diameter of 35 km. Its height, deter-mined using GLD100 dataset [3], amounts to 200 m and the average slope angle \u03be corresponds to 0.65\u00b0. Its edifice volume was estimated of 97 km3. An elongate depression can be seen on the eastern flank of the dome, extending approximately 7 km and 50 m depth, the irregular shape explicable in terms of a collapse feature due to subsurface magma migration or as a source vent (Fig. 1c). Clementine UVVIS multispectral mosaic displays oval spread of vent deposits associated with graben. Note the discrete nature of several other foci of LPD's on the dome surface (termed P to U in Fig. 1d). Spectral data: Clementine UVVIS multispectral data indicate a higher titanium concentration for the dome and associated deposits which show up bluer than the surrounding mare (Fig. 1e). It has a R415/R750 ratio of ~0.63 and a 750 nm albedo of 0. 092, while the nearby mare units have lower R415/R750 ratios of ~0.60-0.61 and a 750 nm albedo of about 0.11. Moreover, our data indicate that the \u201crelatively\u201d higher TiO2 and FeO value [4] is associated with the LPD if compared to nearby mare soil not covered by the dark pyroclastic material (Figs. 1f-g). The M3 spectral data indicate that the absorption band of the dome and the mare surface east of it slightly exceeds 1 \u00b5m. The 2 \u00b5m absorption is quite flat while the 1 \u00b5m absorption is shifted towards higher wavelengths but not broadened as expected for olivine (Fig. 2). Thus the spectra would be attributed to glass or also to a mixture of glass and olivine, as indi-cated in the Clementine spectral data. No spinel signa-ture was identified.  The spinel deposits, including chromite, present in the Sinus Aestuum II region [5-6], are defined by their strong 2 \u00b5m absorptions and extremely weak or absent 1 \u00b5m absorptions.       Results and discussion: The environs of the dome present a rather complicated picture (Fig. 3), with evi-dence of extensional forces in the form of faults and graben, compression in the form of wrinkled ridges, pyroclastic volcanic activity in the form of cone (Fig. 1) and finally subsurface magmatic activity as evi-denced by collapse features. Using the GDL100 dataset it is possible to determine that this feature is not a sec-tion of flat LPD draped mare, but forms a low profile dome like structure elevated above the mare surface to the east and north. A graben that appears to cut the dome is a narrow (approximately 400 m) trough that extends for some 20 km extending from the Caley Formation terrain and across the western part of the dome, interpreted as fracture features that may occur as a result of the flexural uplift [7], likely originated by a magmatic intrusion associated with dikes that ascended to shallow depths below the surface [8]. Even if the bulk of the magma does not reach the surface but re-mains as an intrusion, it is possible that some connec-tion between volcanic products and the surface may occur through the fractures that form to allow the graben floor to subside. Hence, intrusive and explosive processes, including pyroclastic material, might be involved into the formation of the large dome Sc1 but not necessarily simultaneously (different volcanic phases), and the different volcanic features in the ex-amined lunar region may even have formed completely independent of each other. The fact that the examined dome Sc1 has a very shallow slope and a large diame-ter is evidence that it has likely originated by a mag-matic intrusion. The intrusive activity was followed by a phase of pyroclastic activity, which was possibly re-lated to the vent identified. The laccolith model in [9] yields intrusion depths of 3.4 km and maximum magma pressure in the laccolith of 27 MPa so that the dome SC1 is a typical representative of class In1 as intro-duced in [9-10].

V.A. Alexeev,  Vernadsky  Institute  of  Geochemistry  and  Analytical  Chemistry,  RAS,  Moscow 119991 Russia; e-mail: AVAL37@chgnet.ru    Introduction:  In analyzing the distribution of cosmic-ray exposure ages of iron meteorites, Shaviv [1] concluded that the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) varied with a period of 143 \u00b1 10 Myr due to periodic passages of the solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. According to more recent data, this period is equal to 147 \u00b1 6 Myr [2]. However, this con-clusion is questioned by other researchers ([3] and oth-er). In this work, we analyzed the distribution of the ages of iron meteorites after more strict selection of ages from the available data set. We compared ob-tained results with results for the model set of ages assuming different periods of the GCR intensity varia-tions.  Calculations and modeling:  The distribution of 82 ages is shown in Fig. 1 (histogram 1). Ages were taken from [4-6]. For correction of ages belonging to paired meteorites (i.e., formed in a single collision), we used the Akaike information criterion [7, 8]. Age dis-tribution of the corrected set is shown in Fig. 1 (histo-gram 2). Further analysis of the distribution of the correct-ed values of ages was made by means of calculating the values of phase (according to [8]) and the study of parameters of the distribution of these values. For each value of the age of meteorite (T), the phase (Ph) was calculated according to the ratio: Ph = T / t - int (T / t). Here t is presumptive period in the distribution of ages and, accordingly, the period of changes in the intensity of the GCR [8]. (Ph values vary in the range from 0 to 1.) Further, for the selected value of t there were calcu-lated the population characteristics of the distribution of phase values: dispersion S2, kurtosis Ek and \u03c72. This procedure was made for the 17 values of t: 100, 150, 200, ..., 850 and 900 Myr. Then, changes of each characteristic as a function of t were analyzed. Results for the \u03c72 are shown in Fig. 2. Here we can see: (a) changes of \u03c72 for the corrected ages of iron meteorites; (b) the same for a model set of 100 random \"true\" values of ages, assuming no variations of the GCR intensity; (c) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 150 Myr, and (d) the same on the assumption of GCR variations with a period of 450 Myr. Models of changes of GCR intensity with such periods are shown in Fig. 3. For meteorites (Fig. 2a), we can see a convincing decrease of the \u03c72 values for t ~ 400-500 Myr (\u03942 = -44 \u00b1 4 %) and less con-vincing decrease for t = 150 Myr (\u03941 = -46 \u00b1 13 %). Also, similar deviations from the mean values were obtained in the analysis of the distributions of the dis-persion S2 and kurtosis Ek. Distribution of the model set of 100 values of \"true\" ages is shown in Fig. 4a. Of course, the distri-bution of the \"measured\" values of ages will be the same if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the last billion years has not changed. Distribution of \"measured\" values of ages will have the form (see Fig. 4b), if the intensity of galactic cosmic rays was varied with a period of 150 Myr. The type of this distribution is significantly different from the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (cf. Fig. 4d). But, the distribution of the \"measured\" ages (Fig. 4c) will be in essence the same like the distribution of ages of iron meteorites (Fig. 4d) in the case of an assumed period of GCR intensity variations of 450 Myr. Conclusions:  The obtained data suggest the ex-istence of the GCR intensity variations with a period of ~ 400-500 Myr during the last billion years. These var-iations may be due to periodic passing solar system through the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Discussed in [1, 8], changes of the GCR intensity with a period of ~ 150 Myr are less certain.

C. Floss1 and A. J. Brearley2. 1Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA; 2Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: Presolar silicates are easily altered or isotopically re-equilibrated by relatively modest degrees of thermal metamorphism and/or aqueous alteration [1\u20133], and have been found in abundance only in certain primitive extraterrestrial materials. As a result, they can be useful tracers of secondary nebular and parent body processes [e.g., 4, 5]. MIL 07687 is classified as a CO3 chondrite [6], but contains unique features that distinguish it from typical CO chondrites [7, 8]. Specifically, the abundance of refractory inclusions is lower in MIL 07687 than in CO chondrites, the amount of matrix (~68%) is higher, and fine-grained chondrule rims, which are common in COs are essentially absent in MIL 07687 [7]. However, the most unusual feature of this meteorite is that it appears to have undergone a unique style of highly localized aqueous alteration [7, 8]. The matrix is texturally complex, consisting of irregularly-shaped Fe-rich (altered) and Fe-poor (unaltered) regions separated by distinct boundaries (Fig. 1).   Figure 1. Back-scattered electron image of matrix from MIL 07687. In other primitive carbonaceous chondrites, high abundances of presolar silicates are typically found in fine-grained matrix regions dominated by amorphous silicates. We are carrying out ion imaging searches in MIL 07687, with the goal of evaluating how the abundances and compositions of presolar grains in the matrix of this meteorite have been affected by the secondary alteration it has experienced. Experimental: We used the Cameca NanoSIMS 50 to carry out C and O raster ion imaging of matrix areas in MIL 07687 that experienced varying degrees of aqueous alteration. The total area we analyzed is 33,900 \u00b5m2; approximately 1/3 of this is Fe-rich altered matrix, while the remainder is relatively unaltered Fe-poor matrix. Following isotopic identification of the grains, we used Auger spectroscopy to determine the major element compositions of the grains, following standard procedures developed for presolar silicate analysis [9]. Results: We found a total of 53 O-rich presolar grains and 21 SiC grains. The overall abundances are 110 \u00b1 15 ppm for O-rich grains and 85 \u00b1 19 ppm for SiC, in good agreement with the abundances determined by [10] for the same meteorite. Most grains belong to either Group 1 or Group 4, but three grains have more elevated 17O/16O ratios, typically referred to as extreme Group 1 grains (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. O three-isotope plot showing O-rich presolar grains from MIL 07687 (red symbols). Other data are from the Presolar Grain Database [11]. Auger analysis of the grains shows that virtually all of them are ferromagnesian silicates; only one oxide grain is present. Elemental compositions are broadly consistent with those of other presolar silicates, with Fe+Mg/Si ratios that are close to either olivine (2.0) or pyroxene (1.0) or are intermediate between these two. Iron concentrations in the grains range from 6 to 32 at.%, with a median of 16 at.%, similar to the ranges and medians observed for presolar silicates from primitive meteorites such as Acfer 094, ALHA77307 and the CR3 chondrites QUE 99177 and MET 00426 [e.g., 1 and references therein]. Discussion: The Fe-poor matrix regions of MIL 07687 consist of amorphous Mg-Fe-bearing silicates and Fe-sulfides, and resemble matrix from 1004.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)other highly primitive carbonaceous chondrites (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the Fe-rich matrix areas are extensively altered and are dominated by fibrous Fe oxyhydroxides (Fig. 3b), possibly ferrihydrite or akagan\u00e9ite [7, 8].  Figure 3. Back-scattered electron images of (a) Fe-poor, unaltered and (b) Fe-rich, altered matrix from MIL 07687. The results of our imaging survey indicate that presolar grains are found in both the more pristine Fe-poor areas and in the altered Fe-rich ones. Thus, the aqueous alteration experienced by MIL 07687 has not resulted in complete destruction of the presolar grains. However, we do see some differences in the presolar grain abundances between the two types of matrix. Figure 4 shows grain densities in the Fe-rich and Fe-poor matrix areas. Overall we observe 2.6 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the unaltered matrix areas and only 1.7 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2 in the Fe-rich altered regions. Considering just the presolar silicates, abundances are again lower in the altered areas than in the unaltered ones. However, the difference is not as large as might be expected given that presolar silicates are more susceptible to secondary alteration than most presolar grain types. In addition to the difference in abundance, we observe compositional differences in the presolar silicates from the altered and unaltered areas. Grains from the altered areas have a lower median Fe content than grains from the unaltered areas, 12.5 at.% vs. 17.5 at.%. This differs from the presolar silicates in the ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite Adelaide, which have a factor of two higher median Fe content than presolar silicates from other primitive meteorites [1]. In Adelaide this difference was attributed to an influx of Fe into the grains due to the thermal processing experienced by that meteorite. The lower median Fe content observed here in grains from the Fe-rich matrix areas may also be due to secondary processing. In this case, loss of Fe may have occurred through leaching of Fe from the grains during aqueous alteration and subsequent formation of the Fe oxyhydroxides.  Figure 4. Presolar grain densities (in # of grains per 1000 \u00b5m2) in MIL 07687. Finally, there is a factor of two difference in the SiC grain density between altered and unaltered matrix areas, 0.4 vs. 0.8 grains per 1000 \u00b5m2. This difference is somewhat surprising, since SiC should be more resistant to secondary processing than presolar silicate grains. A possible explanation is suggested by the fact that Fe oxyhydroxides rather than phyllosilicates are the dominant alteration product in the Fe-rich matrix areas, indicating that alteration occurred under highly oxidizing conditions [7]. This may have contributed to the partial destruction of presolar SiC grains in those matrix areas affected by aqueous alteration. References: [1] Floss and Stadermann (2012) MAPS 47, 992.

C. Floss. Laboratory for Space Sciences and Physics Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. (Email: floss@wustl.edu)  Introduction: In addition to the first unambiguous cometary samples, from comet 81P/Wild 2 [1], NASA\u2019s Stardust mission was designed to collect the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust. The Stardust interstellar dust collector collected particles for 229 days during two exposures prior to the spacecraft encounter with Wild 2 and tracked the interstellar dust stream for all but 34 days of that time. The Al foils make up ~15% of the total collection surface and about 12-15 particles, with 2/3 of those less than ~1 \u00b5m in size, were expected to have impacted the available Al foil area. The initial investigation of these samples took place under the auspices of the CAPTEM-approved Stardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination (ISPE). The ISPE proposed to carry out non-destructive, non-invasive searches for, and analyses of, interstellar dust candidates in the Stardust interstellar tray and focused on two parallel investigations: extraction and analysis of tracks in aerogel identified through Stardust@home, and search for and characterization of impact craters in the aluminum foils [2].  The work of the ISPE team resulted in the discovery and characterization of seven probable  interstellar dust particles [3], four of which were identified from impact craters in the Al foil [4]. At the formal conclusion of the ISPE two years ago, only ~5% of the available Al foil area had been measured. We have continued the work of scanning Al foils from the Stardust interstellar tray in order to identify additional interstellar dust candidates. Here we report the results of our work to date. Experimental: Foil scanning is done in automated mode using the JEOL 840a SEM at Washington University. By combining our instrument control software with custom written software, we are able to automatically map an entire foil in a single (long) run. Foils are divided into multiple grids of about 0.25 mm2. Manual z-axis focusing is done in the center of each region, after which the grids are further divided into individual images 106 x 80 \u00b5m in size. The z-axis positions are interpolated from one grid center to the next to ensure good focus for all individual images in a grid and the x, y, and z coordinates are individually stored. The images are mapped at 15 kV, 5 nA for 10 sec per frame, providing a resolution of ~50 nm/pixel with a dwell time of 0.001 sec/\u00b5m2. The entire array is imaged automatically in sequence, and each image is saved with a unique label identifying its position on the foil.  Images from the foils (~5000 for short foils and ~10,000 for long foils) are manually examined independently by at least two undergraduate students, and the candidate craters identified are subsequently ranked. The most likely candidates are then imaged at higher resolution to ascertain which are actual impact craters. Results: We have scanned a total of four long (N) foils and two short (W) foils: 1010N, 1031N, 1032W, 1047N, 1061N and 1063W. Image examination is still in progress on foil 1010N, but we have identified a feature on this foil that appears to be an unusually large impact crater (Fig. 1). However, additional analysis (e.g., Auger spectroscopy and/or FIB/TEM) will be needed to confirm the identification. A similar feature found on foil 1047N during the ISPE ultimately turned out to be a hole created during the foil flattening process [4].  Figure 1. Secondary electron image 314@43 from interstellar foil 1010N,1. The impact feature is approximately 4 \u00b5m in diameter. Approximately 2700 candidate craters were identified from the other foils, of which 1125 were selected for higher resolution imaging. Table 1 shows the resulting 19 likely impact craters. Eleven of these were investigated as part of the ISPE [4]; the remaining eight are shown in Fig. 2. While some are clear impact craters, others are more ambiguous and, like 314@43 mentioned above, will require additional analysis for confirmation. Outlook:  The number of impact craters identified on individual foils is clearly highly variable and the foils examined by our laboratory as part of the ISPE fortuitously contained a relatively high proportion of craters. Moreover, many of the potential new impact 1005.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)features shown in Fig. 2 are unconventional compared to \u2018traditional craters\u2019 and it remains to be seen whether compositional analyses can confirm an extraterrestrial or even secondary impact origin for these features. Despite these obstacles, the results of the ISPE demonstrate that continued scanning and examination of the Al foils on the interstellar collector has the potential to provide important new information about contemporary interstellar dust.

John D. Arfstrom, jarfstrom@gmail.com, www.JohnArfstrom.com, 904.200.2619. Introduction: Terrestrial anastomosing glacial troughs and streamlined landforms matching the ideal-ly formed channel systems of Mars are lacking. The disparate geology and topography of Earth and Mars may well have variably influenced the erosion of such landforms, which are probably more ideally formed on Mars due to the spatial uniformity and erodibility of the wide expanses of crater scarred, pristine regolith plains. Likewise, the circular ramparts that craters present against the onslaught of erosion, compared to the random forms typical on Earth, would be reflected in the geometries of eroded forms. An important ques-tion to be addressed is: how would ice sheet-generated landscapes on Earth appear if not influenced by pre-existing channeling, topography, and structure of bedrock? Considering the morphology of Kasei Valles, might regolith have supported the generation of its ideally-shaped streamlined landforms akin to the well-formed islands of glacial spillways, yet through the processes of large-scale glacial erosion evidenced by its extant areal scour indicative of wet-based erosion? Discussion: There are examples of terrestrial ice sheet-generated landforms for which landscape consid-erations might explain the above mentioned disparity.  Fig. 1a shows Kasei Valles, an erosional landform net-work comprised of interconnected or anastomosing channels or troughs, supposedly breached and non-breached streamlined landforms, and valley-wide areal scour. Thought to be a flood or glacial spillway chan-nel system, Kasei Valles is here interpreted as a set of glacial troughs and streamlined landforms, likely erod-ed by sub-polar ice sheets [1]. A terrestrial analog can be seen in Fig. 1b. It shows a portion of eastern Ellesmere Island recently exposed by the retreating ice sheet where several streamlined landforms are visible among a network of interconnected glacial troughs. Though the landforms at Kasei Valles are more curvi-linear, whereas more angular at Ellesmere, this could be explained by the uniform and easily eroded regolith, compared to the structured and resistant bedrock. Also, the widespread areal scour at Kasei Valles (Fig. 2), which extends over most streamlined forms, is more consistent with the uniform areal scour typical of ice sheets than the more spatially variable and local-ized erosion typical of the generally more focused ero-sion caused by floods. This is because the pressure melting point within ice sheets (see explanation below) promotes sheet-like erosion, except where geologic and topographic factors promote channelization.  The erosion of the exposed landscape at Ellesmere Island occurred at the base of the nearby ice sheet be-fore it retreated. Although related to intermediate-scale asymmetric and symmetric erosional landforms such as roches mountennees, whalebacks, rock drumlins, and crag and tails, the scale of the landforms are more consistent with \u201clarge-scale selective linear erosion\u201d associated with sub-polar ice sheets, which are cold-based where thinner and warm-based where thick enough [1]. Ice streams within the ice sheet slid across the bedrock with varying velocities, both spatially and temporally, to erode the anastomosing network of troughs. Although inundated by the ice sheet, the streamlined landforms were marked by relatively less basal sliding and erosion than the troughs, having been overlain by thinner, slower moving or stagnant cold-based ice. Similarly, \u201cnon-breached\u201d streamlined land-forms at Kasei Valles may have been inundated by cold-based ice, but were spared the erosion evidenced by the areal scour of adjacent lower topography. The causes of these spatial variations of erosion are better understood if one imagines the pressure melting point, where sliding may occur, as a dynamic, 3-di-mensional layer at depth, controlled by ice thickness   and basal and flow variations [1, 2]. Erosion principal-ly occurs beneath thicker ice where the pressure melt-ing point is met, where warmed by geothermal heat flux, frictional heating, and through heat transfer by water. As erosion continues, enhanced by positive feedback through increasing frictional heating and ice thickness, subglacial troughs lengthen, widen, deepen, and even connect, influenced by parameters such as topography, pre-existing channelling, and faults. Also, as ice flows from a given area, the ice thins and the pressure melting point may drop below the ground surface, causing sliding to cease and flow velocities to decrease in that area. These positive and negative feedback mechanisms cause an ice sheet to maintain a sheet like flow, yet erode troughs where velocities are highest. Anastomosing of troughs result from long-term fluctuations in ice drainage patterns within an ice sheet, represented by linked-flow networks or evolving or switching time-transgressive flow patterns.  In line with these considerations and other morpho-logical interpretations, including those previously pre-sented elsewhere [3, 4, 5], I argue for a sub-polar ice sheet-based interpretation of Kasei Valles, in which variable and widespread erosion induced areal scour and stripped regolith to leave behind its streamlined 1006.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)landform and trough system. This possible glacial ori-gin of Kasei Valles is related globally to other valley systems on Mars in an previous abstract and an associ-ated poster paper, which outlines ongoing research [6].

D, 00137 Rome, Italy; r.lena@sanita.it;.        Introduction: Lunar mare domes are smooth low features with gentle convex upward profiles. In this contribution we provide an analysis of three effusive domes located in the eastern lunar regions near crater Aristoteles N, Plana G and Plana F, which have previously not been examined in detail. The first examined dome is located at longitude 25.44\u00ba E and latitude 52.24\u00ba N with a base diameter of 6.0 km (Fig. 1). It is a previously unreported dome, which we named Aristoteles 1 (Aris1). Another dome, bisected by Rimae Daniell, located at 24.86\u00b0 E and 38.45\u00b0 N and having a diameter of 9 km, has been termed Plana G1 (P1). It displays three protrusions which probably are pre-existing non-volcanic hills. The third examined dome is situated to the north of P1 and to the east of Plana F, at longitude 39.32\u00b0 E and latitude 13.50\u00b0 N, and has a diameter of 7 km (Fig. 2, dome termed P2).       Spectral properties: For both domes, Clementine  UVVIS spectral data indicate a R415/R750 ratio of about  0.56-0.57 indicating basalts of low TiO2 content and furthermore reveal a 750 nm reflectance of R750 = 0.13 for P1-P2 and 0.16 for Aris1, and a weak mafic absorption for two domes in Lacus Somniorum with R950/R750 = 1.06, suggesting a high soil maturity. The dome Aris1 has a lower R950/R750 ratio of 1.01 (Fig. 3).   Fig. 1. Aristoteles 1 dome marked with arrows.

Rheologic properties: The rheologic model developed in [5], which depends on the morphometric dome properties, yields estimates of the lava viscosity \u03b7, the effusion rate E, and the duration T of the effusion process for a monogenetic lava dome. Using the morphometric values listed in Table 1, we obtained lava viscosities between 8.8 x 104 and 3.0 x 106 Pa s, effusion rates between 60 and 75 m3 s-1, and durations of the effusion process between 0.6 and 2.5 years (Table 2). Furthermore, we estimated the magma rise speed U and the dike geometry (width W and length L) according to the model developed in [6]. We found that the magma ascended at speeds between 2.0 x 10- 5 and 6.8 x 10-6 m s-1 through dikes of widths between about 20 and 65 m (Table 2). The dome Aris1 is a typical representative of rheologic group R1 as defined in [1], characterised by lava viscosities of 104-106 Pa s, magma rise speeds U of 10-5-10-3 m s-1, dike widths W around 10-20 m, and dike lengths L between about 30 and 150 km. Rheologic group R2 is characterised by low lava viscosities between 102 and 104 Pa s, fast magma ascent (U > 10-3 m s-1), narrow (W = 1-4 m) and short (L = 7-20 km) feeder dikes. The third group, R3, is made up of domes which formed from highly viscous lavas of 106-108 Pa s, ascending at very low speeds of 10-6-10-5 m s-1 through broad dikes of several tens to 200 m width and 100-200 km length. The domes P1 and P2 are typical representatives of rheologic group R3. Hence, for three examined domes the magma reservoirs are located well below the lunar crust regarding the thicknesses of the total crust of about 55 km [7].     References: [1] W\u00f6hler et al.

Introduction: Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes are some the largest volcanoes on Mars and in our Solar System. Our team is funded by NASA\u2019s Mars Data Analysis Program (MDAP) to complete a set of 1:1,000,000 geologic maps of Olympus, Arsia, Pavonis, and Ascraeus based on the mapping style defined by [1,2]. Figure 1 shows the area around each volcano that we are funded to map, including additional sections that cover the rift aprons and small vent fields. Detailed mapping of a limited area of these volcanoes revealed a diverse distribution of volcanic landforms within the calderas, and along the flanks, rift aprons, and surrounding plains [1]. Here, we report on the progress of each map.   Figure 1. MOLA shaded relief map with the bounda-ries (solid lines) for each map and extensions (dashed lines) to cover rift aprons and small vent fields.  Data and Methods: We are mapping each vol-cano in ArcMap 9 and 10.2 to produce digital geo-logic maps at 1:1,000,000 map scale for the USGS. A Context Camera (CTX) mosaic serves as the primary basemap, supplemented by High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), THEMIS daytime IR, HiRISE, and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data. To ad-dress our science questions we have conducted our mapping at ~1:300,000 to ~1:100,000 on the CTX basemap. This scale enables us to distinguish be-tween different morphologic features like sinuous rilles, leveed channels, low shields, and surface tex-tures (hummocky, mottled, smooth), plus we are able to determine flow margins, flow directions, and strat-igraphic relationships between different eruption sequences. Our primary objective for each map is to show the areal extent, distribution, and stratigraphic relationships of the different volcanic morphologies to better understand the changes in effusive style across each volcano and provide insight into the similarities and differences in their evolution. Mapping Progress: Each map is in a different stage of the geologic mapping process. The Ascraeus Mons map is the most recently funded project and we will begin preliminary mapping in 2015. The maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes are also nearing comple-tion and should be ready to submit for publication by mid to late 2015 (Fig. 2). The Olympus Mons map has complete line work and is being prepared for submission to the USGS for publication (Fig. 3). For the Tharsis Montes, our objective this year is to map the contacts between different volcanic provinces on each volcano (e.g., main shield, rift aprons, and lava plains). We have mapped the surficial fan deposits on Pavonis and Arsia Mons using sketch maps from [4-6] as guides for mapping similar units (e.g., smooth, ridged, knobby). See Dapremont et al., this meeting [Abstract #1605] for detailed mapping of the Arsia Mons fan shaped deposit.  Figure 2. Maps of Arsia and Pavonis Montes1008.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Discussion:  Our current progress has provided sev-eral insights into the eruption processes and evolu-tion of these volcanoes. Geologic Units: The current mapping units have evolved from the original proposed mapping units to correspond with units used for the recent geologic map of Olympus Mons [6] (Fig. 3).  Detailed image-ry from CTX has allowed us to diversify the units based on various eruption styles. The units are dis-tinguished primarily by morphology and are grouped for each edifice (main shield, rift apron, fan deposit, lava plains). General Formation Sequence: Mapping reveals a similar sequence of events for the evolution of the three Tharsis Montes volcanoes [1,2,8]: 1) main shield forms, 2) eruptions from the NE/SW rifts em-place long lava flows that surround the main flank, 3) eruptions wane and build up the rift aprons and shield fields, 4) glaciers deposit surficial fan deposit material [9], and 5) localized recent eruptions along the main flanks, in the calderas, and within the fan-shaped deposits. Further mapping will reveal the relative geologic timing of eruptive units on the main shields and provide a more complete analysis of the spatial distribution of tube-fed versus channel-fed flows for each volcano and how they compare with Olympus Mons as originally discussed by [1].

Introduction: Lunar sinuous rilles are thought to have formed by thermal erosion, mechanical erosion, construction, or a combination of these processes via emplacement by lava tubes and/or lava channels [1-4]. The investigation of Hadley Rille by Apollo 15 pro-vided the first field observations of a rille, including outcrops of stratigraphic layers within the far rille wall  [5]. High-resolution remote sensing data sets from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter allow for the identification of smaller volcanic features, outcrops, layers, and detailed topographic measurements at the meter-scale [6,7]. Several questions relate to layers observed in the rille walls including: 1) What is their stratigraphic sequence and can individual flows be defined? 2) Are the layers a sequence of multiple, old-er eruptions that have been thermally eroded? 3) Which layers are related to the eruption that formed the rille? Each visible lineation that defines a layer, may not be a surface contact between individual flows, therefore 4) How can individual flows be distinguished within the stratigraphic sequence? and 5) What flow processes can be recognized based on characteristics of the wall rock (inflated pahoehoe) [8]?      Terrestrial volcanic features with similar morphol-ogies to lunar rilles can provide insight into their for-mation on the Moon. While the scale of most lunar rilles are much larger than their terrestrial counterparts, there are several examples similar in scale to ones we have documented in Idaho. The SSERVI FINESSE team (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System Sci-ence and Exploration) [9] conducted field studies at Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve (COTM) in Idaho from July 28 \u2013 Aug. 8, 2014 to in-vestigate terrestrial analogs for lunar volcanic and im-pact features [10]. Here, we compare field observa-tions at Inferno Chasm (Figs. 1,2), a rille-like channel in Idaho to Isis (Fig. 3), a similar sized rille on the Moon.  Inferno Chasm (42\u00b058\u201900\u201dN, 113\u00b011\u201925\u201dW) is a basaltic low-shield with a vent and sinuous channel (Fig. 1). The area is overgrown with sage and desert grasses, but it appears that the margins of the low shield have been embayed or buried by subsequent lava flows or loess making it difficult to define the true extent of this volcanic feature and locate lava deposits beyond the end of the channel.   Figure 1. Inferno Chasm in Idaho. (A) Location of Differen-tial GPS and LiDAR surveys [Google Earth]. (B) Morpho-logic sketch map of key flow features and structures.    We documented the geology and morphology of Inferno Chasm using a Riegl Vz-400 LiDAR, a Trim-ble R8 and TopCon Hiper II Differential Global Posi-tioning Systems (DGPS) (Fig. 2), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and sampling. The main vent crater is roughly circular and is ~200 m wide, ~20 m deep and has a small 2.5 m-high mound in the center (Fig. 2). DGPS survey D-D\u2019 shows that the sinuous channel extends to the west while dropping ~10 m over ~1700 m, yielding a slope of -0.005\u00b0 (Fig. 2). Several over-flow channels are also visible in the remote sensing images (Fig. 1B), but are subtle in the field. For exam-ple, DGPS profile C-C\u2019 is 350 m long, 30 m wide, and 2-5 m deep. Outcrops of the vent walls expose massive layers 2-3 m thick with textures that suggest highly welded spatter overlain by a 1-2 m thick sequence of thinner layers (overspills, shelley, gaseous blisters) each 10s of cm thick. Field observations and samples collected indicate low-shield development typical of the Eastern Snake River Plains [11]. 1009.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Lunar Rilles: Isis, a rille in Serenitatis Basin (19\u00b0N, 27.5\u00b0E) (Fig. 3) has a similar morphology to Inferno Chasm. The feature is ~1.3 km wide and ~60-70 m high at the vent. The channel is ~3 km long, 283 m-wide, and 25 m deep [7]. The rille is located within high-Ti basalts and there are no identifiable deposits extending from the end of the channel. The vent is aligned with three other small cones along a north-west-southeast trending graben, possibly related to an intrusive dike. There are boulders present along the rim of the rille, but no distinct layers are visible in the images.  Figure 2. Differential GPS profiles A-A\u2019 across the vent (North to South) and D-D\u2019 along the channel floor (East to West) of Inferno Chasm (see Fig. 1A).  Discussion: Field observations of the wall material at Inferno Chasm suggest the feature was constructed through a combination of thin lava overflow, rheo-morphic flow of congealed spatter, and intense weld-ing of deeper parts, with or without additional lava injection, to form the thick, massive layers. Evidence of thermal erosion and/or lava tube collapse along the channel were not identified, but have not been ruled out. Distinct levees were not identified along the chan-nel margin, but there are linear, topographic highs near the mouth of the channel (Fig. 1B).  Isis has several similarities in both morphology and scale to Inferno Chasm. Both are topographic highs with a central channel ~2-3 km long. No distal depos-its are identified beyond each channel. Isis is atypical compared to larger sinuous rilles, like the example in Marius Hills shown in Fig. 3B. Most lunar rilles ap-pear to carve into the local terrain through thermal erosion [7]. We suggest Isis was formed by construc-tion, from a highly gaseous, fire fountain eruption that created spatter that collected to form the cone and spat-ter-fed flows rather than by thermal erosion. Observa-tions of flow textures in exposed layers and rocks can help interpret the flow processes that formed the rilles [8]. For example, the planar, vesicle horizons observed in rocks along the rim of Hadley Rille are consistent with inflated pahoehoe [8], whereas the tumultuous textures observed in the boulders and wall rock at In-ferno Chasm are consistent with welded spatter. How-ever, given the much larger scale of most lunar rilles, construction may only be a minor component of their formation. Based on the depth of a rille, assumptions on how much the wall represents eroded substrate ma-terial and which layers formed via construction is im-portant for determining parameters for thermal erosion models.

Berkeley, 3British Astronomical Association, 4Jet Propulsion Lab, 5Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.   Introduction:  Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot (GRS) is one of its most distinct and enduring features, having been continuously observed since the 1800\u2019s.  It cur-rently spans the smallest latitude and longitude size ever recorded.  Here we show analyses of 2014 Hubble spectral imaging data to study the color, structure and internal dynamics of this long-live storm. Physical Dimensions: The GRS\u2019s red edges have contracted from a longitude length of ~21\u00b0 during the Voyager flybys in 1979 to ~15.5\u00b0 in Hubble data ac-quired in 2012, shrinking on average 0.19\u00b0/year over the modern era [1]. Amateur observers documented a sudden decrease in longitudinal extent in early 2014, faster than the average rate of contraction, and Hubble Space Telescope time was granted to characterize the current state of the storm.  In the 2014 Hubble data, the red edges of the spot span about 14.1\u00b0 in longitude, a decrease of 1.4\u00b0 (1760 km) in 21 months, a rate of change four times greater than typical since 1979.   The GRS\u2019s latitudinal size has been much more constant, historically spanning between 10.5\u00b0 and 11\u00b0, and is currently 9.4\u00b0, the smallest size measured to date.  There has been a slight overall trend toward lati-tude shrinkage of 0.04\u00b0/year, significantly slower than in the longitude dimension, but the fastest change of 0.7\u00b0 occurred between 2012 and 2014.  Though the storm has a clearly diminishing length-to-width aspect ratio, from 1.8 in the Voyager era (and much greater historically) to 1.5 currently. 1980 1990 2000 2010Date510152025GRS Size (degrees)Visible Length, spacecraftVisible Width, spacecraftVisible Length, groundVisible Width, groundDynamical LengthDynamical Width Figure 1. Measurements of the GRS\u2019s size.  Visible edges, which are somewhat subjective, are often used to mark its size.  Amateur measurements (red) show scatter, but are consistent with spacecraft data. Dynam-ical measures of the narrower high velocity collar also show a trend towards smaller size.   Figure 2. Visual comparison of the GRS\u2019s size in 1995, 2009, and 2014.  Colors have been arbitrarily enhanced for consistency.  Spectral Analysis: Another notable characteristic of the 2014 images is the deep red color of the GRS, which is normally seen only during climatic cycles when the adjacent South Equatorial Belt (SEB) \u201cfades\u201d or whitens, such as during the Pioneer flybys in 1974 [2].  Spectroscopy was performed using Hubble imag-es from 1995 to 2014 to determine the visible color of the darkest core of the storm, Fig. 3.  In this region, the reflectance spectrum (I/F) is fairly constant [3,4].  The greatest change of up to 0.08 in I/F can be seen near 410 nm when comparing data from 1995 and 2008.  The data acquired in 2014, however, show that the spectrum of the GRS is depressed by 0.1 to 0.15 in I/F at all wavelengths shorter than 500 nm.  In addition, reflectance in the 890-nm methane gas absorption band has increased by ~0.11 in I/F since 2009, using the same filter, implying the altitudes and/or the concen-trations of upper tropospheric aerosols have increased [5]. Spectra of other red regions on the planet do not show simultaneous increases in methane-band reflec-1010.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)tivity and visible reddening, ruling out calibration is-sues.  Spectral change is also obvious in the core of the GRS; ratio images indicate that the spectral slope from 630 to 500 nm has steepened in 2014 compared with previous dates over most of the GRS.

Spectral Imaging from Hubble shows dra-matic change in brightness and slope in 2014.  Winds: The internal wind speed of the GRS can top 150 m/s, in a high-velocity collar that is smaller the visual diameter of the storm [1,6,7].  Automated veloc-ity field extraction was attempted from the 2014 data, using the ACCIV method with correlations calculated for box sizes of 5\u00b0 in latitude/longitude, between pairs of velocity field advected images [6].  The quality of the extracted velocity field was insufficient to accu-rately constrain the location and magnitude of the high-speed collar around the vortex due to limitations of the imaging data, e.g., the shadow of Ganymede over the western side of the vortex in the later three frames resulted in only tie point pairs from short 43-min separations over large parts of the GRS rather than 10 hours.  The eastern area of later frames in both or-bits also suffered from reduced contrast due to proxim-ity to Jupiter\u2019s limb.   We identify tangential velocities in the 100\u2013150 m/s range, with higher speeds at the north-south extrema of the vortex, where it interacts with zonal jets, but with larger uncertainties than typi-cal.  Thus, preliminary manual and automated meas-urements of cloud motions showed no significant in-crease in wind speed when compared with winds measured from 1996 to 2006 [1,6,7], implying an in-ternal circulation period of about 3.2 days. Wind Jet Interactions: The sudden shrinkage of the GRS and its observed color change are likely to be in response to changes in jet interactions. The reduc-tion in width is due to shifts of both the northern edge (latitude mean 1979-2012, 16.8\u00b0 S +/-0.3; 2014, 17.4\u00b0 S) and the south edge (latitude mean 1979-2012, 27.4\u00b0 S +/-0.2; 2014, 26.8\u00b0 S).  This causes reduced deflec-tion of the jets north and south of the GRS, altering the zonal wind shear environment sensed by the vortex.  Decreased interaction with small vortices carried by those wind jets may be the reason for the intensified red color in 2014.  In particular, the GRS is now suffi-ciently withdrawn from the westward jet at 19.5\u00b0 S that it does not ingest vortices carried by that jet.  Similar-ly, during SEB fading events there are no vortices be-ing carried by the jet toward the GRS and its color intensifies [2,8].  Conclusions:\t \u00a0 The GRS interacts with the zonal wind jets, with energy or momentum exchange of un-known magnitude. It is not yet understood what colors the clouds and why they can vary in spectral slope and absolute brightness, though the current spectrum may be indicating a change in colored-particle production.  Further analyses of the temperatures, winds, and size of the GRS, especially in epochs of change, will pro-vide interesting constraints to analytic models of geo-strophic balance in the region.  In addition, global cir-culation modeling of the GRS in its flow field for dif-ferent dates will show which configurations are most stable to decay.

R. E. Jacobsen1 and D. M. Burr1, 1University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA 37996 (RJacobse@vols.utk.edu and dburr1@utk.edu).  Background:  The geomorphology of precipita-tion-fed fluvial activity suggests a transition from wetter conditions to drier conditions in martian history [1 & refs. therein]. The Aeolis Dorsa (AD) region, located between Aeolis and Zephyria Plana and south of the Cerberus lavas [2], contains numerous sinuous ridges and fans interpreted to be inverted fluvial deposits [e.g., 3-8]. These deposits, when arranged stratigraphically, are a microcosm of martian fluvial history [cf. 7]. In addition to a rich fluvial history, the region has experienced burial by volcanic ash and/or aeolian deposits of the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF), exhumation through aeolian abrasion, forming yardangs [9 & refs. therein], and topographic modification by collapse or tectonic processes [5]. The most common inverted fluvial features are flat-topped sinuous ridges and ridge networks [3]. Some ridges have semi-concentric lineations similar to terrestrial meander deposits, which on Earth, generally require more steady hydrologic conditions [10]. These deposits have been interpreted as scroll-bars [3] or laterally aggrading channel beds of meandering rivers [8]. Inverted fluvial features imply some inurdation [4 & refs. therein], likely by geochemical cementation, followed by erosion of host MFF [4]. Thin sinuous ridges, some of which appear stacked above flat-topped inverted fluvial features, have been interpreted as inverted paleochannels from a second episode of fluvial activity [3,4,6]. The fan-shaped features connect to inverted paleochannels or paleochannel networks, and have been interpreted as alluvial fans [3,7], which on Earth have intermittent flows and \u201cflashy\u201d discharges [11]. Hypothesis:  Previous analyses [e.g., 3-8] suggest the following sequence of events for the formation of AD. (a) Long-duration, meandering rivers deposited sediments within valleys at least a few kilometers wide. (b) MFF deposits infilled these river valleys. (c) Sinuous but narrower rivers exploited some of the same river valleys, depositing sediment within these (stratigraphically higher) channels. (d) Fluvial sedi-ments from both (a) and (c) were indurated. (e) River valley walls (MFF) were eroded, resulting in topo-graphic inversion of (a) and (c). (f) Relief developed along the interior margins of Aeolis and Zephyria Pla-na. (g) Alluvial fans formed along interior margins. (h) Fans became indurated. (i) MFF deposits covered the region. (j) Exhumation and erosion inverted the (indu-rated) fans and revealed the (previously inverted) flu-vial features of (a) and (c). (k) Local to sub-regional deformation (e.g., by collapse or tectonism) occurred. The transition from wetter to drier conditions are in-ferred from the deposits of events (a), (c), and (g). Methods:  To test the geographical extent of this hypothesis, stratigraphies were made and compared among geospatially distributed locations, Area 45N and Area 40 (Figure 1). Hypothesis testing required images from the Context Camera (CTX) [12], High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) [13], and topography from CTX digital terrian models, derived from Ames Stereo Pipeline [14]. Boundaries for geomorphological units were delinated in ArcMap software. Interpretations of inverted fluvial features, lava units, and yardangs were based on previous inter-pretations described in the background [2-9].  Figure 1: Black boxes mark locations for geomorphological and stratal observations presented here, and previously [6]. Results: Area 45N:  Flat-topped ridges, consistent with broad deposits of inverted fluvial channels or flu-vial valleys [3,4], are hosted within the lowest unit (fd) (Figure 2). A superposed thin ridge, interpreted as an inverted fluvial channel, points to later deposition of a subsequent fluvial unit (fct). This stacked assemblage indicates two episodes of fluvial activity. NW-SE-oriented yardangs cross-cut thin inverted channels (unit fct), cover inverted fluvial deposits (unit fd) and intra-ridge areas, indicating that units fct and fd were inverted, covered by MFF, and later eroded by aeolian abrasion. An alluvial fan grades into NW-SE yardangs that superpose unit fd, indicating that the fan formed in a unit (af) deposited with or after deposition of MFF. 1011.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Area 40:  Flat ridges with interior, semi-concentric curved ridges, consistent with inverted fluvial meander deposits [3,4,8], are hosted within unit fm (Figure 3). Narrower flat ridges, consistent with flat-topped in-verted fluvial channels [3,4], are hosted within unit fcf. Unit fm cross-cuts unit fcf, indicating that unit fcf is older than unit fm. A unit of thin inverted fluvial chan-nels (fct) superposes unit fm, indicating a third period of fluvial activity and subsequent inversion. A mound-forming unit (mu) has many small craters, and troughs that terminate at a unit of fans (af), indicating a fourth period of fluvial activity. Discussion:  The formation of Area 45N is similar to the hypothesis. Deviations from the hypothesis oc-cur in events (a), because evidence for meandering (i.e., semi-concentric lineations) is lacking, and event (k), since no evidence of deformation is observed [5]. The stratigraphic history in Area 40 differs from the hypothesis. Older paleochannels of unit fcf indicate that, depending on location, event (a) may consist of one or more stratal units (i.e., members). Troughs in unit mu that lead to fans (af) also differ from the hy-pothesis. In Area 40, relief was created along unit mu, followed by precipitation, run-off, sediment transport, and deposition. In many other areas of AD, including Area 45N, the host unit for the fans (unit mu) has been eroded, leaving inverted paleochannels and fans. Conclusions:  The transition from wetter to drier hydrological conditions is preserved in the stratigraphy of Aeolis Dorsa, beginning with fluvial deposits of greater hydrologic stability (e.g., meander deposits in Area 40 and integrated fluvial channels or valleys in 45N) and ending with hydrologically intermittent allu-vial fans in both areas.  Measurements of paleochannel morphology by area and stratal unit will be coupled with scaled form-discharge relationships [4,7,15 & refs. therein] to esti-mate paleodischarge through time.

R. E. Jacobsen1 and D. M. Burr1, 1University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN USA 37996 (RJacobse@vols.utk.edu and dburr1@vols.utk.edu).  Background:  Empirical form-discharge relation-ships derived from terrestrial rivers [e.g., 1,2] and scaled for difference in gravity, are commonly used to estimate flow discharges (m3 s-1) of Martian pale-ochannels [e.g., 3-7]. Discharge estimates are used in various models with implications for ancient climate [8-9]. Regression analyses of terrestrial channel form (e.g., width, wavelength) and discharge records pro-duce form-discharge relationships: Qn=aXb, where Q is the discharge of a flood with a recurrence interval of n number of years, a and b are constants, and X is a measurement of form [1-2]. Bankfull discharge is rec-ognized as the most effective flow for moving channel sediment over time, controlling channel form, and may be approximated by the Q2yr [10]. Sediment size in the channel bed and banks has profound effect on the relationship between discharge and channel form [1]. Form-discharge relationships not specific to any category of sediment size (Table 1), refered to here as \u201cnon-specific\u201d relationships, were derived from regression analysis of 252 channels with various sediment sizes (clays to cobbles) in the Mis-souri River Basin [1]. Equation 1 is the most common-ly used relationship for estimating paleodischarge on Mars [3-7] because there is a dearth of information about fluvial channel sediments [11 & refs. therein]. Relationships derived from channels with specific sed-iment sizes, refered to here as \u201csediment-specific\u201d rela-tionships, are derived from analyses of 2 channels in the Sand Hills, NE (Eq. 2) and 15 mud-rich channels in the Missiour River Basin (Eq. 3) [1].  Table 1: Form-Discharge Relationships [from 1] Eq. Relationship Sediment Type Stand. Error 1 Q2yr=1.9W1.22 Non-specific 79% 2 Q2yr=0.031W1.86 Sand-dominated 26% 3 Q2yr=2.0W1.86 Mud-rich 52% Terrestrial analogs provide helpful opportunities to test the relationships in Table 1 among channel form, discharge, and sediment size. The Usuktuk River on the North Slope, Alaska and Quinn River in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada (Figure 1) [12] have been inves-tigated as potential analogs for meandering channels in the Aeolis Dorsa region, Mars [5,12,13], based on their well-developed meanders in permafrost and low-vegetation floodplains, respectively. These channels in Alaska and Nevada are sand-dominated and mud-dominated, respectively. How well do form-discharge relationships predict discharge in these well-sorted and possible analog channels? Hypotheses:  Null: The influence of sediment size on channel width for a given discharge is irrelevant across all sediment sizes. If true, this hypothesis would validate the common use of non-specific relationships. Alternative: The influence of sediment size on channel width for a given discharge is relevant across all sedi-ment sizes. If true, this hypothesis would require the use of only sediment-specific relationships. Methods:  Hypotheses were tested by comparing records and/or models of Q2yr and predictions of dis-charge derived from width measurements coupled with non-specific and sediment-specific relationships. Although no gauge record exists for the Usuktuk River, it is a tributary of the Meade River. The Meade has a gauge record from 2006 to 2014 and has similar sediment and hydrological regimes as the Usuktuk [14]. We carried out the analysis using data from the Meade River. Discharges of peak streamflows for the Meade River at Atasuk, AK indicate the Q2yr is 702 m3 s-1 (waterdata.usgs.gov). There is no nearby gauge sta-tion for the Quinn River, NV, but we use an in situ estimate of bankfull discharge, 11.9 m3 s-1 [15], as an approximation of the Q2yr. Observations of aerial photographs and digital ele-vation models of the North Slope of Alaska (5-m res.)  and Quinn River (1-m res.) were made using ArcMap software. For both rivers, samples of channel width were made by measuring bankfull width every 500 meters of channel length. Bankfull width was meas-ured as the distance between the abrupt change in slope, nearest to the channel, on opposite banks. Sam-ples of channel width were coupled with a non-specific form-discharge relationship (Eq. 1) and the relevant sediment-specific relationship (either Eq. 2 or 3) to create distributions of predicted discharge. Results:  Measurements of bankfull width and es-timates of Q2yr, from the outputs of form-discharge relationships, are shown in Table 2.  Table 2: Average bankfull width & estimated Q2yr  Meade River, AK Quinn River, NV Bankfull width 248 m (\u03c3=71.4 m) 15 m (\u03c3=3.6 m) # of widths 177 44 Q2yr 702 m3 s-1 11.9 m3 s-1 Q2yr (Eq. 1) 1600 m3 s-1 (\u03c3=565) 48 m3 s-1 (\u03c3=12) Q2yr (Eq. 2) 936 m3 s-1 (\u03c3=512) n/a Q2yr (Eq. 3) n/a 280 m3 s-1 (\u03c3=109) 1012.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Discussion:  For the sand-dominated Meade River, the accuracy of discharge predictions increased when width measurements were coupled with the sediment-specific relationship rather than the non-specific rela-tionship. In this case, the null hypothesis can be reject-ed and the alternative hypothesis can be accepted be-cause the relationship between channel form and dis-charge is influenced by the properties and abundance of sand. Sand is the most mobile sediment, and causes large variation in channel width for a given flood dis-charge [1]. If channels on Mars are sand-dominated, conventional use of non-specific form-discharge rela-tionships will overestimate Q2yr. For the mud-dominated Quinn River, the accuracy of discharge predictions decreased by coupling width measurements with the sediment-specific relationship compared to the non-specific relationship. In this case, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. If channels on Mars are mud-dominated, use of non-specific form-discharge relationships will also overestimate Q2yr. Thus, in either case, these results indicate that dis-charge estimates on Mars made using non-specific relationships are overestimates.   Future Work:  This work will be advanced by sta-tistical analyses to determine the significance of differ-ences between Q2yr and discharge predictions from non-specific and sediment-specific relationships. New form-discharge relationships for mud-dominated chan-nel (as opposed to mud-rich channels) may be derived from analysis of channels in the Basin and Range, NV. References:  [1] Osterkamp W.

Introduction:  The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity encountered potassic sedimentary rocks along its traverse to Mount Sharp. Those rocks are primarily located in two geological units: a light-toned topographically variable, or  Rugged unit ; and overlying light-toned striated rocks forming a  Striated unit  [1]. They have been primarily analyzed by the ChemCam instrument that combines a LaserInduced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument [2, 3] and a Remote Micro-Imager (RMI) [4] at two waypoints informally named Cooperstown (sols 438 to 453) and Kimberley (sols 576 to 632). The acquisition of more than 50 ChemCam rocky targets at those two locations provides a good sampling for analyzing the spatial and stratigraphic compositional variability within the Rugged and the Striated units. Here, we report a synthesis of the chemical composition of the potassic rocks as seen by ChemCam according to their stratigraphic unit and facies at Cooperstown and Kimberley. Stratigraphy and rock facies:  Cooperstown (4.62 N, 137.42 E) is a topographic depression located between -4495 m and -4493 m in elevation. It is associated with the Rugged unit, which is topographically above the Yellowknife Bay Formation (YKB) investigated during the first phase of the mission [1]. The Cooperstown formation can be subdivided into two members: a nearly flat-laying  Pine_Plains member  corresponding to fine-grained sandstones; and an overlying  Rensselaer member  characterized by a ledge of well-cemented pebbly sandstones containing float clasts. Kimberley (-4.64 N, 137.4 E) is an area between 4484 m and -4479 m in elevation marked by the presence of three mounds (Fig. 1A). The Kimberley formation includes seven members, which are in stratigraphic order: the basal Point_Coulomb member constituted of breccio-conglomerates analyzed by ChemCam on sol 550 in the Violet Valley; the Liga member made up of planar-bedded very coarse sandstones containing granules; the Square_Top member corresponding to south-dipping faintly-laminated sandstones; the Dillinger member containing cross-stratified sandstones in which Curiosity drilled; the butte-forming massive sandstones of the Mt. Remarkable member; and fine-grained resistant boulders possibly related to the Hummocky Plains unit, or  Beagle member  (Fig. 1B) [5, 6]. The Dillinger and Mt. Remarkable members are associated with the Rugged unit and are located stratigraphically between the Hummocky Plains unit and the Striated unit. The Square_Top and Liga members are associated with the Striated unit (Fig. 1B). Chemical composition:  The sedimentary rocks of the Cooperstown and Kimberley formations have a basaltic-like composition according to Partial Least Squares (PLS), a multivariate regression method [7] (Fig. 2A). Those sedimentary rocks primarily differ in composition from the previously encountered  Fig. 1: Overview of the Kimberley formation.

(A) Average composition (wt%) of each member determined by PLS. The drill tailings and the Mn-rich targets are not taken into account in the average composition of the Dillinger member. (B) Average composition of the potassic rocks normalized to Sheepbed (YKB). Error bars are standard deviation of the compositions and primarily reflect heterogeneity within each member. (C) ICA score plot of K component versus Na component. Sheepbed and Bardin_Bluff (conglomerate, Darwin waypoint) are indicated.  sedimentary rocks in YKB or the conglomerates in Darwin [8] by their significantly higher content in K2O not coupled to higher Na2O, except for the Point_Coulomb member (Fig. 2B). The Dillinger and Mt. Remarkable members (Rugged unit at Kimberley) especially display the rocks most enriched in K (Fig. 2A). An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [9] reveals that the Na/K ratio of the Dillinger and the Mt. Remarkable members is much lower than for the other members (Fig. 2C). The K-feldspar and illite clays identified in the Dillinger member by CheMin [10] are consistent with this enrichment in K. Overall the K abundance gradually increases between the lower Striated unit (Liga and Square_Top members) and the Rugged unit (Dillinger and Mt. Remarkable members) in the Kimberley formation. The Rugged unit exposed at Kimberley shows a higher K content than at Cooperstown. Hydrogen is present in all potassic rocks analyzed by ChemCam [12], which is consistent with the presence of hydrous minerals such as clays [10]. ChemCam analyses also reveals high contents in F [13], Li, Mn [14], Zn [15] and Ni in the Kimberley formation, and in Mn in the Cooperstown formation.  Interpretation and discussion: The sedimentary rocks encountered at Cooperstown and Kimberley differ in composition from those in YKB by their enhanced K content. Assuming a fluvial origin of those sediments [5], the progressive shift to higher K from Cooperstown to Kimberley implies a contribution of a potassic source rock with increasing effect at Kimberley. The increase in K from the lower members to the upper members at Kimberley also suggests a gradual increase of this contribution with time. The origin of this source is currently unknown [16] but could be Krich intrusions or K-rich ash layers on the Gale rim. The stratigraphical relationships with the other sandstones (such as YKB) being unclear, it is not possible to determine if this K-rich source was incised during the overall deposition of fluvial sandstones or the final gasp from a divergence in the fluvial flow type/direction or watershed extent. The presence of F, Mn and Zn in Kimberley rocks also suggest that alteration processes, possibly pre- and post-depositional may have contributed to their enrichment in K.

Its laser pulses remove dust and to profile through weathering coatings of rocks up to 7 m away. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) produces emission spectra of materials ablated from the samples in electronically excited states. As the plasma cools, elements can recombine and molecular emission lines are observed. Recent experiments [3] have shown that some of  these molecular emissions can be much brighter than the associated atomic lines, especially when halogens and rare earth elements are present. We observed these molecular emissions in some of the ChemCam spectra and report the first dectection of chlorine and fluorine with ChemCam. It is also the first time ever that fluorine has been detected on the surface of Mars [4]. Among all the F-bearing observations, one third are observed in the Kimberley outcrop. We will discuss the potential mineralogies related to these observations as well as the related elemental correlations and propose interpretations. Kimberley geological description: Curiosity spent sols 572-632 analyzing outcrops of sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate in a region of Aeolis Palus informally named the Kimberley formation. The exposed strata contained three informal members: the lowermost  Square Top  member, an overlying  Dillinger  member, and the uppermost  Mt. Remarkable  member [5]. Following reconnaissance, the Dillinger member became the target for drilling at a site named Windjana. The drilled outcrop exposed sandstones with centimeter-scale stratification organized into bedsets 10-20 cm thick that display low angle, planar to trough crossbedding. A range of sediment transport directions, reconstructed from crossbed dip directions, suggests complex paleoflow hydraulics with a primarily southwesterly flow in an ancient fluvial (or possibly mixed fluvial-aeolian) system [6]. The Dillinger member is crosscut by  fins  that are more resistant than the surrounding rock. These features are interpreted as thin, mineral-filled fractures that were exposed by differential aeolian abrasion of the surrounding country rock. The veins cross-cut depositional stratification at shallow angles; in places the fractures run parallel to bedding planes, perhaps exploiting them as zones of weakness. We infer that this fracture network created the porosity and permeability that allowed subsurface fluids to move preferentially along these paths of higher hydraulic conductivity. Mineral precipitation occurred during fluid flow, and eventually occluded much or all of the fracture porosity. Kimberley elemental composition as seen by ChemCam: Kimberley rocks differ in composition from previous study areas in Gale such as the Sheepbed member in Yellowknife Bay [7, 8, 9]. This is confirmed by the elemental compostions obtained on the 676 observation points by the ChemCam instrument. A striking charatereistic is that the rocks at Kimberley are enriched in K, which matches the substantial fraction of K-feldspar observed by X-ray diffraction data from the CheMin instrument [15%; 10]. K2O concentrations can reach up to 10 to 12 wt.%. All Kimberley rocks also show elevated Fe and Mg. Ca and Na are relatively low. Trace elements Li, Rb, Zn, Ni are strongly enriched. As much as 7.0 wt.% ZnO in the Yarrada target (Sol 628) was detected [11]. Targets Stephen, Neil, and Mondooma were also found to contain very high MnO contents, with > 30 wt. % MnO near the surface [12]. Fluorine observation in Kimberley: 36 observations show the characteristic molecular CaF emission at 603 nm (Fig. 1.). The F content of these observations ranges from 0.2 wt.% up to 0.8 wt.%.   Figure 1: Kimberley CCam spectra showing the characteritics feature of the CaF molecular emission around 603 nm. To achieve quantification, experiments have been conducted mixing fluorite with a certified basalt powder standard, BHVO-2, under martian pressure conditions on the ChemCam-dedicated setup at LANL. 1989.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)Twelve mixing ratios ranging from 0.07 wt.% to 50 wt.% CaF2 were analyzed and for each mixture five observation points were acquired. The 30 spectra at each observation point were averaged together. After careful processing of the data [13] it is possible to draw a relationship between the area of the CaF emission band centered at 603 nm and the amount of fluorine present in the sample. With these new calibration experiments, a detection limit of about 0.2 wt.% fluorine is reached [4].  It is  notable that these CaF observations are spread throughout all units of the Kimberley outcrop. Interestingly, all 9 points of the Dillinger target (Sol 628) contain fluorine at a level of about 0.5 wt.%, indicating that fluorine is present in one of the major phases and not as accessory phases..  Correlation with major elements: Among the Kimberley observations, fluorine is generally correlated with K, Al, Si and Mg in that decreasing order. These correlations suggest that the F-bearing phase may be compatible with a silicate phase. Of the phases determined by CheMin in the Windjana drill sample the likeliest hosts are clay minerals or the amorphous component. Several ChemCam points having around 0.6 wt.% F and 5 wt.% Ca display a positive Ca-F correlation, making fluorite [CaF2] a plausible phase. Fluorite was not detected by CheMin but may be present below XRD detection limits.  Figure 2: Plot of the Li content vs. the MgO content for targets having more tha 0.2 wt.% F. Correlation with minor and trace elements: In Kimberley, fluorine is mainly correlated with lithium. The average lithium content in these high fluorine targets is of the order of 50 ppm with a maximum of about 140 ppm in the point  Frome_Rock-5. The value of 50 ppm is comparable to what is observed at Bathurst_Inlet [14]  Lithium observation in Kimberley: The average lithium content is of the order of 25 ppm for the 676 observations on the Kimberley outcrop. This value is much larger than the average Li content of 5 to 10 ppm observed so far with ChemCam [14] and in the SNC meteorites [15]. For those targets that contain fluorine, lithium exhibits a very strong correlation with magnesium (Fig. 2).  Interpretation: On Earth, fluorine and lithium are widespread in micas [16]. This is of great importance in the study of clay minerals because of the degradation of the micas, by weathering, through illite to mixed-layer clays and then to smectites which are observed in the CheMin data [10]. The lithium is generally not retained by clay minerals at the site of this transformation; because it is highly mobile, it is soon weathered out of the mica and either carried away in solution or incorporated into the structure of newly formed clay minerals. Although undetected by CheMin, micas may occur in sediment source regions and they should be considered as possible lithium sources. A relation may exist between the content of lithium and the content of fluorine in smectites. In samples of smectite containing less than 1 wt.% fluorine, the lithium content increases with the fluorine content [17]. High temperature hydrothermal processes in granodioritic settings  are often  invoked to explain these mineralogical associations, with formation of clays from chloritization of micas These alteration processes are accompanied by feldspathization at temperatures above 300 C. However, illite/micas and Mg-smectites may provide from distinct alteration type, the latter suggesting more low-T alteration, so that the observed minerals may not form in a single process. Alteration of source rocks at high-T occurring first and then alteration of transported sediments by fluids during diagenesis occurring next. Finally, when the temperature decreases to ~100 C, fluorite can precipitate in place simultaneously with the zinc and manganese oxides. References: [1] Maurice S. et al.

Introduction:  The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity has encountered a variety of sedimentary rocks in Gale crater with different grain sizes, diagenetic features, sedimentary structures, and varying degrees of resistance to erosion. Curiosity has drilled three rocks to date and has analyzed the mineralogy, chemical composition, and textures of the samples with the science payload. The drilled rocks are the Sheepbed mudstone at Yellowknife Bay on the plains of Gale crater (John Klein and Cumberland targets), the Dillinger sandstone at the Kimberley on the plains of Gale crater (Windjana target), and a sedimentary unit in the Pahrump Hills in the lowermost rocks at the base of Mt. Sharp (Confidence Hills target). CheMin is the Xray diffractometer on Curiosity, and its data are used to identify and determine the abundance of mineral phases. Secondary phases can tell us about aqueous alteration processes and, thus, can help to elucidate past aqueous environments. Here, we present the secondary mineralogy of the rocks drilled to date as seen by CheMin and discuss past aqueous environments in Gale crater, the potential cementing agents in each rock, and how amorphous materials may play a role in cementing the sediments. Methods: The CheMin instrument collects Co-K  X-ray diffraction patterns in a Debye-Scherrer transmission geometry, and the resulting 2D patterns are converted to 1D patterns by circumferential integration (Fig. 1). Rietveld refinement techniques produce unit cell parameters for individual minerals [1], and FULLPAT models determine abundances that include poorly crystalline and amorphous phases [2]. The composition of the amorphous component is calculated by subtracting the composition of all crystalline phases as determined through models of CheMin data from the bulk APXS composition of the drill fines [3,4]. Sheepbed Mudstone: Models of CheMin data from John Klein and Cumberland show that the major phases in the Sheepbed mudstone include plagioclase, pyroxene, trioctahedral smectite (Fe-saponite), and amorphous phases (Fig. 2a,b) [5]. Minor phases include magnetite, anhydrite, bassanite, akaganeite, sanidine, and pyrrhotite. Smectite, Ca-sulfates, and akaganeite are secondary minerals that may be cementing the Sheepbed mudstone. Furthermore, the mineral assemblage suggests that the saponite and magnetite are authigenic and formed in-situ from the alteration of olivine and amorphous material [5-7]. Calculations of the amorphous component show that the amorphous materials are enriched in FeOT, CaO, Na2O, SO3, and P2O5 and depleted in SiO2, Al2O3, and MgO relative to a basaltic glass composition [5]. These calculations are being updated based on new refinements of unit cell parameters (see Morris et al., this meeting), but the values suggest the amorphous material is secondary and may be composed of nanophase Fe-oxides (npOx), amorphous sulfates and phosphates and/or sulfate and phosphate chemisorbed to surfaces of nanophase materials [8], and minor amounts of amorphous silicates Dillinger Sandstone: The unit cell parameters for the minerals in the Windjana target are being refined at the time of this writing. Models of XRD data show that the major phases in the Dillinger sandstone include pyroxene, K-feldspar, magnetite, phyllosilicate (illite and/or smectite), and amorphous phases (Fig. 2c). The minor phases include plagioclase, akaganeite, anhydrite, pyrrhotite, ilmenite, and hematite (see Treiman et al., this meeting, for a complete discussion). Phyllosilicate, anhydrite, akaganeite, and magnetite are potential secondary minerals that may help cement the Dillinger sandstone. The origin of these phases (i.e., authigenic or detrital) is unknown. Preliminary calculations of the amorphous component in Windjana show that it is enriched in FeOT, MgO, and SO3, and depleted in SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, and Na2O relative to a basaltic glass composition. This composition suggests that the amorphous component is made up of secondary phases, possibly including npOx, amorphous sulfates, and minor amounts of amorphous silicates. Pahrump Hills: Unit cell parameters for the minerals in the Confidence Hills target are also being refined at the time of this writing. Models show that the major phases are plagioclase, pyroxene, hematite, phyllosilicate (smectite and/or illite), and amorphous materials (Fig. 2d). Minor phases include magnetite, forster2038.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)ite, K-feldspar, and jarosite (see Cavanagh et al., this meeting, for a complete discussion). Phyllosilicate, hematite, and jarosite are potential secondary minerals that may help cement these sediments. The origin of these phases is currently unknown. Preliminary calculations of the composition of the amorphous component show that it is enriched in SiO2 and SO3, suggesting that it is secondary, may have formed in a leaching environment, and may help cement these sediments. Discussion: There are a variety of secondary phases that may cement the rocks at Gale crater, and if these phases are authigenic, they imply that the sediments experienced different aqueous conditions and multiple fluid episodes. The presence of Ca-sulfates and saponite in John Klein and Cumberland suggests an aqueous environment with low ionic strength and near neutral pH [5]; however, the presence of akaganeite suggests acidic fluids also affected the sediments. The abundance of K-spar and the potential presence of illite in Windjana must be considered when interpreting the formation of the Dillinger sandstone because these phases can form in diagenetic K-rich environments on Earth [e.g., 9]. The presence of Fe-sulfates in Confidence Hills rather than Ca-sulfates indicates an episode of acidic aqueous fluids in the sediments at the base of Mt. Sharp, and the hematite and jarosite could have formed in-situ from oxidized Fe-rich fluids. Calculations of the amorphous component in each rock suggest amorphous phases are secondary and the composition varies between samples. References: [1] Rietveld H. M. (1969) J. Appl. Cryst., 2.

Introduction and Rationale:  The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on the Mars Science La-boratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity, is an arm-mounted bulk chemistry instrument that performs high-precision in-situ measurements of rocks and soils [1]. Compared to the Mars Exploration Rover APXS, the MSL APXS is 5x more sensitive and has a Peltier cooler that im-proves the nominal ambient operational temperature from -40o C to -5o C [1, 2]. The increase in sensitivity and improved integration during warmer temperatures allows the APXS to characterize a larger area than its nominal field of view (FOV) by utilizing a raster tech-nique. Morning or evening rasters can be used to inves-tigate sample heterogeneity (compositional and/or tex-tural) on the order of the APXS FOV.  Arm-mounted instruments, including the APXS, have placement uncertainty (accuracy <15 mm; preci-sion <10 mm) [3]. Arm placement adds uncertainty to the interpretation of APXS data given an in-contact APXS FOV of ~15 mm [1]. Here, we combine APXS data with images from the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) to constrain APXS positioning on the Mar-tian targets Sayunei, Stephen and Morrison (Fig. 1). Figure 1: MAHLI images of APXS raster targets Sayunei (top left, sol 165), Stephen (top right, sols 627-629) and Morrison (bottom, sols 767-779).  Method:  MAHLI images were analyzed by classi-fying pixels into orthogonal bins based on the assump-tion that visually distinct phases have a distinct APXS composition. The orthogonality correlates directly to elemental and/or spectral variation observed in the APXS data. The APXS raster FOVs are overlaid on the MAHLI image. The positional assumption, given iden-tical MAHLI and APXS targets, is that the central APXS FOV is aligned with the center of the MAHLI image. The pixels within each APXS FOV are ana-lyzed and tabulated based on their radially dependent contribution resulting in a relative abundance of each phase for each APXS FOV. The test raster is translated and/or rotated to assess a different orientation. The linear relationship between phase abundances and the appropriate APXS spectral variation is compared using a bivariate weighted least squares regression [4] to infer a more-likely APXS raster position and orienta-tion. Sayunei is a mudstone from the Yellowknife Bay area (John Klein class [5]) with a cross-cutting vein. APXS data collected from a 2x2+1 raster showed ele-vated CaO and SO3 in three of the five raster positions and was complimented by MAHLI images of the cen-tral APXS spot only [6]. This light-toned vein material is visually distinct, resulted in CaO and SO3 variation in the APXS spectra and is interpreted to be CaSO4. As the amount of vein material in the APXS FOV increas-es, the SO3 measured by the APXS will increase. This linear relationship between vein material (light-toned pixels) and SO3 (wt%) was used to infer an APXS ras-ter position that not only agrees with proportionality but also with upper- and lower-limit bounds (Fig. 2). Stephen is a thin fracture fill/layer within silt/sandstone at the Kimberley waypoint. APXS data collected from a 2x2+1 raster showed variation in the APXS norm (proxy for instrument standoff) as well as dust-dependent signals. The APXS raster was compli-mented by 5 cm MAHLI images on the all raster spots. Pixels from the MAHLI image(s) were classified as either dust, rock or negligible based on pixel saturation level and sample topography. A combination of ele-mental and topographic linear relationships was used to infer a more-representative APXS raster position (Fig. 3). Morrison is a brushed, raised, diagenetic feature at the Pahrump waypoint [7, 8]. APXS data obtained via a 2x2+1 raster showed elevated MgO, SO3, Ni and, to a lesser extent, Cl and Br in the diagenetic feature rela-tive to the immediately adjacent bedrock [7, 8]. MAHLI images of the target were taken on earlier sols of the central APXS raster spot only. As with Stephen, a ternary pixel classification system was used on Mor-rison, binning pixels orthogonally as dust, bare rock or 2049.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)rosette, with various linear correlations to spectral het-erogeneity observed in the APXS data.  Results and Observations:  Improved positioning of APXS rasters through MAHLI pixel analysis result-ed in significant shifting (4-8 mm) of the APXS raster center from the center of the MAHLI image consider-ing the size and sensitivity of the APXS\u2019s FOV. APXS placement deviation from the center of MAHLI images is comparable to observed offsets of a Dust Removal Tool brushed center and a post-brush MAHLI image center (i.e. ~3 mm offset on sol 755 Maturango). The APXS raster edges are not parallel to MAHLI image edges as confirmed when MAHLI images are acquired on each APXS raster spot.  APXS raster positioning for Sayunei exists within arm placement uncertainty such that the elevated CaO and SO3 observed is attributed to the vein material and is not elevated in the host rock (Fig. 2). Combining target topography and visually distinct phases im-proved the Stephen raster location (Fig. 3, rotation was minimal as initial orientation was dictated by MAHLI images of each APXS raster location). The best-agreement raster offsets from MAHLI image center for Sayunei and Stephen are in the same direction, despite the flipped arm orientation between the two locations, hinting perhaps at a systematic placement error (Fig.4). A preliminary analysis of the Morrison raster indicates strongly that the APXS raster is offset from the MAHLI image center as well. Conclusions:  APXS rasters are a powerful tool for quickly analyzing heterogeneous samples. MAHLI images with visually distinct phases can reduce APXS FOV uncertainty, ultimately improving interpretation of the target and its geological context.  Figure 2: Early raster position (top, raster parallel to MAHLI image edges and centered on 5 cm MAHLI image) and improved raster position (bottom) yielding a strong correlation between vein material in the APXS FOV and APXS SO3 concentration (wt%). For scale, the central APXS FOV diameter is ~15 mm. Figure 3: Raster position yielding an improved corre-lation between radially weighted APXS FOV pixel fill and measured APXS norm. The updated position also improved the correlation between dust-related signals and the amount of dust in the APXS FOV.  Figure 4: Correlation plots of Sayunei (top) and Ste-phen (bottom) illustrating a raster center offset of ~8 mm and ~4 mm respectively from the appropriate MAHLI image centers (marked by X) to the region of best agreement (dark red).

Windjana is remarkable in containing an abundance of potassium feldspar (and thus K in its bulk chemistry) combined with a low abundance of plagioclase (and low Na/K in its chemistry). The source of this enrichment in K is not clear, but has significant implications for the geology of Gale Crater and of Mars. The high K could be intrinsic to the sediment and imply that the sediment source area (Gale Crater rim) includes K-rich basalts and possibly more evolved rocks derived from alkaline magmas. Alternatively, the high K could be diagenetic and imply that the Gale Crater sediments were altered by K-rich aqueous fluids after deposition.  Kimberley and Windjana:  The Kimberley area (~4.6 S,137.4 E) was targeted for investigation from orbital (HiRISE) imagery because at least three distinct sedimentary units are exposed in contact there [1]. Uppermost is a massive sandstone, which may include the resistant capping unit encountered frequently on Curiosity s traverse. Next is a thinly bedded, cross-bedded sandstone   the  Dillinger Unit.  The lowest exposures are of the  striated unit  documented from orbit; it consists of thinly bedded siltstone, sandstone, and minor conglomerate dipping generally to the south. The MSL team selected a target in the Dillinger Unit, named Windjana, for mineralogical analysis.   CheMin X-ray Diffraction:  The Windjana rock was drilled on sol 621, following a successful minidrill test of rock properties and stability. The drill sample was sieved to <150  m, and an aliquot was delivered to CheMin on sol 622 into an unused Mylar cell. It was analyzed [2-4] for 23 hours total over sols 623 632 (Fig. 1). A second aliquot was delivered on sol 640 to a Mylar cell that had been used previously and dumped; it was analyzed for 22 hours over sols 640 656.  2-D diffraction images were corrected for geometry and hot pixels on the spacecraft, further despeckled manually on the ground, and converted to 1-D diffraction patterns [5]; results for the pristine cell are discussed here (Fig. 1). Diffraction peaks were identified, and proportions of crystalline phases were determined by Rietveld refinement, using commercial codes Jade  and Topas ; Table 1 is a new refinement. Detection limits for crystalline phases are at best ~0.5% wt. [2], depending on their absolute peak intensities and  2  positions relative to those of more abundant phases. The proportions of amorphous components were calculated with the program FULLPAT [6]. Both aliquots of the Windjana drill powder contained the same minerals in similar proportions.  Mineralogy: The minerals in the Windjana sandstone are typical of basalt, with limited aqueous alteration (Table 1); its mineral proportions are notable for its high abundances of K feldspar and of iron oxides (Table 1). These mineral proportions are reflected in Table 1.

As in other rock samples analyzed by CheMin, Windjana contains significant proportions of phyllosilicates and amorphous material.  The olivine is Fe-forsterite (Fo50-70) and the plagioclase is andesine (~An40). The alkali feldspar is K-rich and partially disordered, based on its b and c unit-cell parameters. A sanidine structurre model gave the best fits; diagenetic K-spar can be similarly ordered. The compositions of augite and pigeonite are not yet constrained. Orthopyroxene (Opx) is present at CheMin s nominal detection limit, but including it improves the model fit to the diffraction pattern.  Many mineral phases suggest low-T alteration or diagenesis. The presence of phyllosilicates is indicated by a sharp diffraction near 1.0 nm (the 001 peak) and a broad shoulder on that peak to lower  2  (Fig. 1). These diffraction features are consistent with (but not definitive for) ferromagnesian smectites with and without collapsed interlayers (analogous to those in the John_Klein and Cumberland samples); other 2:1 phyllosilicates cannot be excluded. The Windjana sample contains abundant magnetite, and minor hematite, akaganeite [ -Fe3+O(OH,Cl)], and anhydrite.  Genesis: The high abundances of K-feldspar and iron oxides in Windjana, also reflected in the APXS chemical analysis as high K and Fe (Table 2) [7], are unusual. The phyllosilicates and iron oxides could represent diagenetic deposits or cements [4,8] as invoked for other rocks in Gale crater. Several rocks analyzed by MSL APXS and ChemCam have high abundances of K2O [9-11], but Windjana is the most extreme. Two explanations of the K abundance have been offered.  Potassic Basaltic Source? The high abundances of K-feldspar and K2O in Windjana could represent the primary, detrital components of the sandstone, and thus its source rocks on the crater wall and rim. If the Windjana sediment represents a single source, it would have been ultrabasic (high FeO+MgO), low in Al & Ca, and ultrapotassic (K2O > 3%, K2O/Na2O > 2 [12]). Such basaltic rocks, ultrapotassic low-Al komatiites, are not known on Earth [13], and would require addition of K to the source region via mantle metasomatism [14]. On Earth, basaltic rocks with abundant K-feldspar rarely contain pigeonite and/or orthopyroxene (but see [15]), which suggests that the Windjana sediments were derived from multiple source lithologies.  Potassic Metasomatism/Diagenesis? The high abundances of K-feldspar and K2O in Windjana could have arisen by metasomatism or diagenesis, and so represent aqueous-phase alteration of either the sediment s protolith or the sediment in place. On Earth, potassic diagenesis is relatively common in clastic and volcanicalastic sediments [16-18], yielding K-feldspar filling voids, and as overgrowths on, or euhedral replacements, of primary detrital plagioclase. On Earth, an authigenic origin is easily demonstrated by microtexural relationships observed in petrographic thin sections   information we presently lack for Mars. Diagenesis like this is consistent with Windjana s geologic setting in a closed sedimentary basin, its relatively high Zn abundance (Table 2; inferred to reflect mobility via fluids [19]), and the inference that the magnetite could be diagenetic or cement [4]. However, such extensive aqueous alteration seems inconsistent with the persistence of olivine and abundant amorphous material.  Conclusions: Several hypotheses could explain the abundance of potassium feldspar observed by CheMin X-ray diffraction of the Windjana drill sample: 1) Detrital K-spar transported from transported from potassium-enriched basaltic source rocks by river systems that fed the crater-fringing alluvial complex; and 2) authigenesis of K-feldspar during the post-burial (diagenetic) alteration of basaltic sandstones, perhaps by the introduction of potassium-rich fluids at elevated burial temperatures. Distinguishing among these ideas will involve coordinated interpretation of data from all of Curiosity s instruments. We are grateful to all the MSL engineers and scientists.

Introduction: High Mn concentrations provide unique indicators of water-rich environments and their redox states. Very high-potential oxidants are required to oxidize Mn to insoluble, high-valence oxides that concentrate Mn in rocks and sediments; these redox potentials are much higher than those needed to oxidize Fe or S. Consequently, Mn-rich rocks on Earth closely track the rise of atmospheric oxygen [1-4]. Given the association between Mn-rich rocks and the redox state of surface environments, observations of anomalous Mn enrichments on Mars raise similar questions about redox history, solubility and aqueous transport, and availability as a metabolic substrate. Our observations suggest that at least some of the high Mn present in Gale crater occurs in the form of Mn-oxides filling veins that crosscut sandstones, requiring postdepositional precipitation as Mn(II)-bearing fluids became oxidized as they moved through the fractured strata after their deposition and lithification, allowing Mn-oxides to precipitate.  High manganese observations:  Three rock targets in the Dillinger member of the Kimberley waypoint were found to have Mn concentrations highly elevated above those of average martian crust and other rocks of the same member: Stephen (sols 611, 619, 630), Neil (sol 619), and Mondooma (sol 625) (Fig. 1) [5]. All of these targets sample resistant fracture fills that crosscut this member. ChemCam manganese abundances at Stephen, Neil, and Mondooma show average MnO abundances of 5.2 wt% (Stephen), 5.3 wt% (Neil), and 6.7 wt% (Mondooma). Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) measurements on Stephen show an average MnO abundance of 3.7 wt%, the highest Mn abundance observed by this instrument in Gale crater to date. The average Mn values from both instruments are well above typical martian igneous values of ~0.4 wt% MnO [6].  Trends with depth:  Mn abundance in ChemCam sampling locations was greatest in the first post-dust shots of the series and systematically decreased with succeeding shots (i.e. depth) (Fig. 2), with a maximum of ~35 wt% MnO on Mondooma location 1, shot 4. Fig. 1. Targets at Kimberley containing elevated Mn. (A) Overview of the Windjana drill site showing targets Stephen and Neil (MCAM 0626ML0026760010302385E01). (B) Closeup of Stephen showing a dark material beneath the surface dust layer;  this target was analyzed by both ChemCam and APXS. Note that the ChemCam analysis locations are visible as small, rounded pits in the rock surface (MAHLI 0627MH0004070000203592R00). (C) The Mondooma target is a fin-like, more resistant feature that stands out from the surrounding outcrop; the highest single-shot Mn detection at Kimberley was found in this target (~35 wt% MnO) (MCAM 0626MR0026790000401609E01).        2893.pdf46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015)These results are consistent with a thin layer containing elevated Mn that was deposited adjacent to the Windjana outcrop material.  Geochemical trends: In ChemCam data, Si and Ca are inversely correlated with Mn, suggesting that the high Mn phase is not a silicate and does not contain abundant Ca. ChemCam did not detect Cl or S in the three high Mn targets; this along with the absence of C above atmospheric levels demonstrates that Mn is not present as a sulfate, chloride, or carbonate phase. The APXS composition of Stephen is generally similar to the Windjana bedrock except for elevated abundances in Mn, Mg, Cl, Ni, Cu, Co, and Zn; however, of the elements showing enrichment, only Ni and Cu show a strong correlation with Mn. These trends imply the presence of Mn-oxides, which are well known to scavenge trace metals from water [7,8]. Passive reflectance spectra of Stephen show it has very dark surface, similar to laboratory measurements of Mn-oxides [5, 9]. Implications for the martian environment: The presence of likely Mn-oxides has important implications for the past redox conditions of Gale groundwater and the martian atmosphere. Very high potential redox reactions are needed to oxidize Mn2+ at circumneutral pH (>>500 mV), which requires either O2 or species derived from O2 (e.g. reactive oxygen species). The subsurface geological setting of the fractures rules out photooxidation as a mechanism for oxidation. Oxychlorine species have been detected by the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument in solid samples throughout the rover s traverse [10-12], some of which can have high enough redox potentials to oxidize Mn(II) [13]. However, none of these oxychlorine detections were associated with Mn enrichments, despite thorough analysis by the CheMin, APXS, and ChemCam instruments [14-17]. Accordingly, we hypothesize that Mn(II)-bearing fluids encountering O2 (or species derived thereby) provides the most reasonable pathway to Mn oxidation and enrichment.  On Earth, O2 is present in groundwaters due to interaction and equilibrium with the atmosphere. Due to the extremely slow kinetics of Mn oxidation, either concentrations of martian atmospheric O2 were much higher in the past than observed today or the timescale for water flowing through these fractures were remarkably long (Fig. 3). Oxidation in a long timescale, low O2 aqueous environment is a less favorable model because chemical weathering in this environment is expected to remove O2 from fluids, making them more reducing rather than more oxidizing over time. Our results suggest that the fluids moving along Kimberley fractures were in at least partial contact with the atmosphere and that the atmosphere contained sufficient amounts of O2 to oxidize Mn. Additionally, the discovery of Mn-oxides at the rim of Endeavor crater [18] suggests that the conditions required to concentrate and deposit Mn were present well beyond Gale crater.
